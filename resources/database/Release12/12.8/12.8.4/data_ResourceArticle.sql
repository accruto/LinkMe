	text = '<p>As a foreign job seeker trying to find work in your new country, the odds are stacked up against you. Not only are you competing against other foreign job seekers, but you&#39;re competing against domestic job seekers who share similar skills and experiences. After working with foreign job seekers from all over the world in every type of industry, I have found that the most common excuse these workers use to explain the lack of interview requests is the fact that they don&#39;t have &quot;local experience&quot;.</p>  <p>It frustrates me so much when I hear this, and I know how depressing it can be to a foreign worker trying to get a foot in the door of their new country. Rather than being put off or depressed by not having &quot;local experience&quot; (and how hard must it be to put on a brave face and carry on), let&#39;s prepare strategies that can improve the chances of finding a job as a foreign visa holder.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Online Networking</b></p>  <p>With no local experience you need to become an expert in networking and become an expert ASAP. Use online networking websites such as LinkedIn to make contacts with as many people as you can. Talk to people in your industry and find out comparisons (and differences) between the role you performed in your country of origin and the types of roles you are applying for in your new country. This way you can incorporate this into your resume and interview preparation. The more you understand about your new country, the greater chance you can prepare yourself for finding a new job.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Think Outside the Square</b></p>  <p>There are many ways to search for job openings - don&#39;t get stuck with just applying for roles online.  My advice is to seek out hiring managers and people in positions to help you. Don&#39;t be intimidated to approach these people directly. Although there may not be a current role open at their organisation, there is a possibility that they may know of other job openings or other areas within their business that is looking to hire. Finding the perfect job takes time and people appreciate pro-activeness. I have heard of stories of hiring managers keeping resumes in their database for over 12 months before positions come up.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Social Networking</b></p>  <p>Step away from the computer and begin to enjoy your new country! Again, the more you can learn about your new country, the more help you will have with your job seeking. No matter what your hobbies are, you can always find other people who share the same hobbies and interest. You can begin to gain local experience by participating in extracurricular activities or even by volunteering. This is a great way to begin to gain local experience.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Patience</b></p>  <p>One of the least favourite words a job seeker likes to hear. Patience. Unfortunately, job seeking takes time. Do not get despondent if you can&#39;t find immediate success. Moving abroad takes a lot of guts, determination and courage. Be proud of your efforts in doing something that many people wish they could do but never try. Finding success may take time but will definitely be worth it in the long run.</p>'

Once you have done this you will be ready to prep for the interview questions, learn how to improve your interviewing skills and begin to think about what you&#39;re going to wear to the interview.</p>  <p>In order to succeed in the interview you need to do your homework on the company. There is no set of rules to how to do your research but preparing yourself as much as possible will greatly enhance your chances of getting hired.</p>  <p>Make sure you use every available resource to help you with your preparation. By doing a basic Google on the company you can easily learn important facts about the company. Publically listed companies are easier to prepare your background research than privately listed companies as public companies are legally required to make certain information available. In the 21st century the Internet has made a lot of the pre interview research more available and easier to find. Don&#39;t forget that you can also use other sources of information like public libraries or bookstores.

After reading about the company&#39;s strategic purchase of a new acquisition, the candidate was able to impress the hiring manager with his (somewhat different) knowledge.</p>  <p>The hiring manager later offered this candidate the role not because he was the smartest candidate, but because he showed his dedication by going the extra step in his interview preparation.</p>  <p>Your research for the job interview preparation should give you a better insight on:</p>  <p></p>  <p>• The history of the business</p>  <p>• How old the business is</p>  <p>• The types of services the business offers</p>  <p>• The hierarchy structure</p>  <p>• How many offices/locations the business has</p>  <p>• Number of employees</p>  <p>• Career progression</p>  <p>• The business culture</p>  <p>• Competitors</p>  <p>• Benefits</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Check out the Competitors websites as well - they are also a good source of information for your job preparation.</p>'

Like most answers, the answer to this question depends entirely on you.</p>  <p>People who list education first on their resumes typically have little to no work experience or are recent graduates, and this is usually the proper way to formulate your resume. Education will never hurt you on a resume, so if you&#39;re applying for a job and have little to no work experience, it&#39;s probably best that you include your education first. You can further boost your resume by including any educational awards you&#39;ve received and you can also list courses you&#39;ve completed that are relevant to the job you&#39;re applying for.</p>  <p>On the flip side, if your work experience far outweighs your education, it&#39;s probably best to include this first, but it&#39;s entirely up to you to decide. It&#39;s important to keep the job you&#39;re applying for in mind when deciding how to construct your resume. Are you applying for a position as a marketing director, for example, and you have 15 years of experience in a similar position? If so, this should be one of the first things a hiring manager sees on your resume.</p>  <p>The most important thing to remember, however, is that both education and professional experience are equally valuable in their own right. If you&#39;re concerned about which to list first on your resume, you can include both of them in your objective statement to make sure that they are both noticed straight away.</p>'

	text = '<p>Just how important is having a country-specific resume to your chances of getting employed? Can the resume that got you a job in the UK be used for the Australian job market? Do you really have to design a new resume depending on the country? </p>  <p>The answer is simple. Just as every resume and cover letter you write needs to be targeted and focused toward the company you are applying for, the same concept is applied toward the job market you are applying for. Different countries expect and require certain information to be present on resumes, and therefore it is critical that your new resume meets the unique requirements of that country. </p>  <p>Just because one country requires including personal details such as marital status or date of birth does not mean this standard applies to others. Not only can this be seen as inappropriate, it can also possible be illegal, and your resume will be deleted before it has even been read!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>European requirements</b></p>  <p>Recently in Europe, the rules for resume writing changed substantially. As part of the European Union (EU), all members follow the same resume criteria and format. The Europass CV was created to &quot;provide citizens with the opportunity to present in clear and comprehensive way information on their qualifications and competences&quot;. </p>  <p>This is a fantastic idea for people applying for roles in Europe as there is a standard template to complete that avoids issues such as cultural differences and different requirements between the countries. </p>  <p>While this may be good for a French national applying for a role in Belgium, the rules change when applying to countries such as the USA, Australia or Asia.</p>  <p>It is typical to see information such as nationality, date of birth and gender on European and Asian resumes.</p>  <p>In South Africa it is even required to have even further personal information such as ID number and ethnicity (the latter to clarify one&#39;s BEE or affirmative action status).</p>  <p>In Australia and the US, however, stricter privacy laws make this personal information unnecessary. In the US, an employer has no legal right to know your age. (They do have a right, however, to ask your age only if local, state, or federal law requires that employees be over a certain age.)</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>USA differences</b></p>  <p>In today&#39;s society the terms &quot;CV&quot; and &quot;resume&quot; are often used interchangeably. Take note, however, if you are applying for a job in the USA, as there are major differences between a &quot;resume&quot; and a &quot;CV&quot;.</p>  <p>An American Curriculum Vitae (CV) is NOT the same as a CV from countries around the world.  What countries outside of the USA know as a &quot;Curriculum Vitae&quot; (or &quot;CV&quot;) is called also called a &quot;resume&quot;</p>  <p>In the USA, the &quot;Curriculum Vitae&quot; is not a resume - it is a longer document and is usually written only by a researcher, educator, or academic.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Thinking of including a picture?</b></p>  <p>When it comes to putting a picture on your resume, different countries have different approaches. In the UK you would never attach a photo, whereas in Germany or France you would. Many Asian countries also include pictures with their applications. In the US and Australia it is not recommended or encouraged. </p>  <p>My personal opinion is to leave your picture off your resume. The most important aspect of your resume is the content and it&#39;s vital to ensure that the reader of your resume is more interested in your skills than what you look like.</p>  <p>With all the differences between resumes around the world, it&#39;s important that you do your research into the country before submitting your resume. A professional resume writer can often help you with the &quot;dos&quot; and &quot;do nots&quot; of resume writing in a certain country, and he or she can also provide assistance with resume format, structure and presentation.</p>  <p>With any resume (no matter where you are applying in the world), focus your content on achievements and value-added duties you have performed. At the end of the day, the employer wants to know how you can add value and what skills, experience and expertise you can bring to the business.</p>  <p>And finally, never embellish or fabricate achievements or qualifications. These will often be exposed sooner or later and can result in dismissal, expulsion or even criminal prosecution in those countries with punitive legal codes.</p>'

I save money and time on transport and what is best is that I can work all day in whatever clothes I desire. If I want to sit in my brand new matching pyjama pants and shirt, well I can because these are just some of the advantages of working from home.</p>  <p>This sounds wonderful doesn&#39;t it? Sitting all day in your pyjamas working on your own schedule? This sounds great in theory, but in reality I strongly suggest against this type of approach.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Always Dress for Success</b></p>  <p>When I am dressed for success and feeling professional, I find that I am more productive and produce far greater work. Sitting at my desk in my corporate attire puts me in a work mood as opposed to making my day feel like a casual day. I obviously don&#39;t suggest putting on your best suit and tie when working from home, but a nice clean and pressed shirt and trousers will certainly put you in the work mode.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Find an area of your house to make into &quot;an office&quot;</b></p>  <p>Although you&#39;re at home, try to find a small space that you can work from. Setting up a small area of your house or apartment to make a working space will put you in the working mood. Have you ever tried working from bed? This is almost impossible, and the amount of work you can do while in bed is not nearly as productive as the work you can do from your desk.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Is working at home for you?</b></p>  <p>Working at home is not for everyone, and many people find that they get too distracted and are not able to be productive. Having good discipline is a major factor in being able to work from home. There are many temptations surrounding you and maintaining motivation can be a challenge. And although it&#39;s nice to have a day outside the traditional office, working from home can be lonely, and with limited social interaction it can often be hard to share ideas.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>  <p>Working from home can be extremely productive and beneficial. Without having the sound of telephones ringing and co-workers talking around you, there is opportunity to get a lot of work completed that you would not have been able to do in the office environment.</p>  <p>My advice is simple. When working from home, dress professionally and set up a workspace where you can best get in the grove to perform your work as best as possible. I personally feel more switched on when I am in my work clothes rather than my casual clothes. Looking like a professional makes me feel like a professional.</p>'

The prosperous decade of the 1990s, when jobs were plentiful and money (not to mention credit) was seemingly free flowing, failed to give way to an equally prosperous 2000s. Individuals seeking employment in this market are finding it difficult to do so, mostly because jobs have disappeared, having been shipped overseas or completely phased out. (Does anyone remember the door to door salesmen selling encyclopaedia sets!)  Job seekers are finding that they must be more strategic then ever in their search for employment.</p>  <p><b>Preparing the job search strategy</b></p>  <p>In order to succeed you need to have an understanding of what it takes to stand out in this tough job market. Those that fail to adequately prepare a job seeking strategy will likely find themselves without a job for the foreseeable future. Job seekers must learn to utilize their personal and social networks, professionalize their resume and develop great interview skills. Each of the aforementioned will greatly improve an individual&#39;s chances of landing a job.</p>  <p><b>Networking</b></p>  <p>Networking is a strategy that many job seekers don&#39;t focus on enough but in today&#39;s society should be the number one strategy at the top of the list. The fact is, many workers can trace their current employment to someone who was kind enough to give them a job lead, a foot in the door or point them in the right direction.  Today, networking has become easier then the ever, thanks, in a large part to the growth of online networking websites.</p>  <p>Social networking websites such as LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook are great places to meet people who share similar interests or who work in the same industry. However, even with the power and reach of social networking websites, a person may want to start their job search using the contacts they&#39;ve developed in their own, personal network. Speak to your family and friends and make them aware that you are job hunting. Don&#39;t be scared to reach out to people who are in a position to help.</p>  <p><b>Professional Resume Writing</b></p>  <p>Having a strong resume is a vital part of the job search process. With unemployment on the rise, the competition for jobs is as fierce as ever. Human resource professionals routinely receive hundreds (sometimes thousands!) of resumes for each and every job opening. In order to even be considered for a job, an individual&#39;s resume must stand out from the pile. If it fails to impress in the first few seconds, the chances of being called in for interview is greatly reduced. Without a professionally written resume that highlights an individual&#39;s skills, experience and achievements the chances of actually getting the job becomes an impossibility and only leads to further despair and stress.</p>  <p>If you are not having the success you desire from your existing resume consider having your resume professionally written or edited. The cost of a resume writing specialist is far less than the cost of not having a job.</p>  <p><b>Interview Skills</b></p>  <p>Having great interview skills is extremely important and gives you the opportunity to shine in person. Actually receiving an interview request is often the hardest part of the job search, therefore make sure you are well prepared for the job interview. Research the company and practice answering potential interview questions. The more information you have on the company the more prepared you will be to answer any tough questions that come your way. The best way to becoming a master interviewee is practice! </p>  <p><b>Staying Positive</b></p>  <p>In today&#39;s tough job market, job seekers should be prepared for a lengthy job search. However, being strategic about your job search can help you remain confident and upbeat during this period. Positivity is important so make sure you surround yourself with positive people. The last thing you need is negativity in your life.</p>'

A well resume will include the use of strategic keywords. Many times recruiters or hiring managers will often skim over the resume looking for keywords or use software programs to find key words.

In order to understand how to answer behaviour questions we need to first define what a behavioural question is.</p>  <p>This type of interviewing is based on the philosophy that your past actions and behaviours will be a good indicator of your future behaviours. Therefore, how you acted to certain circumstances in your previous job is a reliable indicator of how you will act in your new job. As there are literally thousands of behaviour type questions, you can best prepare for this type of questioning by researching the culture of the company to get an understanding of the behavioural traits that are essential to working at that particular organisation.</p>  <p>Behavioural questions differ to standard interview questions as they focus more on experiences, behaviours, knowledge, skills and abilities. Rather than the standard question of &quot;Do you have leadership skills&quot; a behavioural question is more likely to be &quot;Give me an example of your previous role when you displayed leadership abilities.&quot; As the interviewer has already determined which skills are necessary for the role it is important that you are prepared for these questions.</p>  <p>The best way to begin studying for these questions is to look at the job description! The list of skills that they require are the skills they will more than likely focus on. When the job description mentions they require a person with good teamwork skills or negotiation skills, it is more than likely that this will be turned into a behavioural question to see if you really do possess these skills.</p>  <p>In good news, behavioural questions are not to be feared.

If you&#39;re concerned about your resume looking too short, there are lots of ways to increase the content without having to lists your hobbies and interests. Think about substituting them for something more work-related, like a section for your professional qualifications or computer-related skills.

He simply expected that one would come, particularly because he hadn&#39;t received one in his entire 2 years there.</p>  <p>I always wonder about this kind of thinking because, from the way I see it, employers are never lining up to give people more money. If you&#39;re waiting around for your boss to give you a raise for no specific reason, you&#39;re going to be waiting for a long time. A raise doesn&#39;t come simply because you&#39;ve worked somewhere for a specific amount of time or because you haven&#39;t received one - you have to earn a raise and, even when you do, you probably still have to ask for it.</p>  <p>It&#39;s no secret that an employer is going to try to pay you as little as possible. I don&#39;t mean this in a mean way - I&#39;m just saying that they aren&#39;t going to go out of their way to pay you more than they have to, simple as that. This especially applies to those of you waiting on that raise you haven&#39;t received yet. Think about it - why would your boss give you more money to do the same exact job? What would be in it for them? Whether you&#39;re deserving of a raise or not, it&#39;s not going to come at the drop of a hat.</p>  <p>Employers are not looking to give away money that they don&#39;t have to, so if you continue to wait for them to offer you one, you may be waiting a while. If you think you deserve a raise, let your boss know and give your specific reasons. This can include examples where you have increased productivity, saved them money or even how you trained new employees.</p>  <p>Providing specific reasons is the key to getting your pay increase. Remember everyone wants more pay and greater benefits. A pay rise is just like a negotiation. You have to provide something in return to receiving something. If you can prove to your employer that you are worthy of a pay increase your employee is more likely to give you one.</p>  <p> One last thing. If you feel you deserve a pay rise and have evidence to support your argument, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for it. A lot of people sit quietly and say nothing to avoid &quot;rocking the boat,&quot; and they have the mindset that a pay rise will eventually happen on its own. Don&#39;t let this happen to you. You deserve to get paid as much as you can.</p>'

Below is a list of things you need to do in order to help you through the job search process…</p>  <p>Keep a routine: Don&#39;t get into the bad habits of waking up late, sleeping in the afternoons or procrastinating around the house. Get up at your normal time, eat properly and get some exercise (walking is free)!</p>  <p>Volunteering at a church, hospital, homeless shelter or non-profit organization will open your eyes to people who are less off than you and give you a sense of contribution. There is no greater reward than helping people who are less fortunate than us.</p>  <p>Stay up to date with what&#39;s happening in your industry: Don&#39;t let yourself fall behind just because you&#39;re not working. The best approach is to learn more about your particular industry. This way you will be ahead of your competition when it comes time to interview.</p>  <p>Explore potential new careers: It&#39;s never too late to try to learn a foreign language or a new piece of computer software. I remember working with a senior archaeologist of 10 years experience who came to me wanting a change in his life direction. After 6 months of learning Spanish and then travelling through Spain for another 6 months, the senior archaeologist is now a junior English/Spanish translator!</p>  <p>Positive Thinking: Do not focus on the negatives - you need to be able to bounce back. Concentrate on the skills and knowledge you have. Sitting around saying &quot;what if&quot; all the time is only going to further depress you.</p>  <p>Support Group: You may feel as though you&#39;re the only person in your situation without a job, but guess what - you&#39;re not. Reach out to people for support. There are many groups that provide excellent assistance in the areas of resume writing, interviewing, and job hunting. Aside from the secular groups, there are also many faith groups ready to offer you a supporting hand. Don&#39;t feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for help. Let people help you change your life.</p>  <p>Avoid negative people! Negative thinking is of no value to you. You need to be around positive people and people who can have a positive impact on your life.</p>  <p>Network: maintain contacts and stay in touch with people. Make sure you network with positive people!! Again, avoid negativity. Negative thinking does nothing to help your situation.</p>  <p>Last but not least - manage your expectations. Not every job you apply for will be a success. Don&#39;t be put off by this. Instead, concentrate on the positives and look at what you achieve each day. For example, you could have applied to 3 great jobs, connected with 2 people who are great resources or maybe you found a course or book that will help to improve your skills.</p>  <p>Don&#39;t give up! Jobs don&#39;t find you, you find them!</p>'

An employer is not just going to hand out extra money to you because they like you - you need to give them a compelling reason to do so.</p>  <p>Basically, you need to give them something that exemplifies your hard work and that shows you are a positive asset to the company. Think of a few ways for doing so - below are just a few examples:</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Arriving on time on a consistent basis</b></p>  <p>No employer likes workers who show up late - ever. If you consistently come to work early or on time, your boss will definitely take notice of this and will appreciate your punctuality. You&#39;ve already given yourself a head start.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Taking on an extra work load</b></p>  <p>Volunteering to do more than what is expected of you helps to build your reputation within the company. You will be recognized as a leader, as someone willing to help out and as someone who can be counted on. You may also gain some valuable experience within other departments, and extra knowledge never hurts. Employers love this type of employee, and will be more likely to go the extra mile to keep them on board.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Keeping track of your performance</b></p>  <p>There is nothing better than being able to show concrete examples of how you have benefited the company. Have sales dramatically increased since you came on board? Do you consistently meet or exceed your targets?</p>  <p>Of course, some people argue that taking on an extra work load or working overtime is a negative because you allow the company to take advantage of you. Well, like it or not, this is how the world works. If you want to stay in the same position year after year, do the minimum, but if you want to move up, putting in that extra effort will be required of you. Raises are not free handouts for everyone - they are reserved for the ones who put in the extra effort. </p>'

	text = '<p>Are first impressions really that important? The answer is... YES!</p>  <p></p>  <p>When the decision comes to hire a new employee, the candidates that are chosen almost always will share similar educational backgrounds, skills and experience. Because of this, it can be the small things that make the difference between getting the job or not. A lousy handshake or dirty shoes can be all it takes to lose out on getting the job.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Top tips to make sure that your first impression counts!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Dressing appropriately</b></p>  <p>A person who looks professional portrays the image of being professional. A person who looks sloppy portrays an image of being sloppy. If two people walk into an office and candidate one is perfectly dressed with clean shoes a shirt tucked in and brushed hair, and candidate 2 walks in looking like they just woke up, it goes without saying which candidate will more likely get the job. Before even discussing their skills, the hiring manager&#39;s first impression about professionalism has already been made.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Hygiene</b></p>  <p>As a hiring manager, I can tell you there is nothing more off putting than interviewing a candidate with bad hygiene. No matter what job you are applying for, bad breath or lack of hygiene is not going to help you to get ahead. There is a fine balance between wearing the right amount of perfume/aftershave or too much. If the interviewer can smell your perfume from across the table you are probably wearing too much!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Addressing the interviewer properly</b></p>  <p>Showing respect toward the interviewer is paramount. Remember the interviewer is not your best friend who you have known for many years. Using slang or shortening their name (&quot;Wassup Dave&quot;) is not the correct way to make a good first impression.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Listening</b></p>  <p>A great mistake you can make in the interview is to speak too much and not answer questions. Interviewing is a 2-way process. Not only do you need to directly answer the interview questions, but you need to listen to what the interviewer is saying. Unless it is a direct yes or no answer, always provide examples and evidence to support what you are saying. Make sure you leave the interviewer with no doubts that you are the right person for the job.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Handshake and Smile</b></p>  <p>When you walk into the interview, a solid handshake and smile will go a long way to building rapport with the interviewer and will also leave a positive memory in their minds after the interview has finished. Typically the person who is interviewing you will often be your boss, and therefore they will want to know that not only do you have the skills required to do the job, but that they are going to want to work with you on a daily basis.</p>'

Like most people, she would search through popular websites and apply for jobs straight away, always including a personalized cover letter and resume. Then she&#39;d wait and &quot;hope for the best&quot;. And nothing happened. It was at this point that she started re-applying for the same positions. And guess what? She received a couple of invitations to interview.</p>  <p>This is not the first time I&#39;ve heard of this happening. In this age of emailed applications and very little personal contact, it&#39;s hard to figure out why the interview requests are not coming. Of course, this has a lot to do with the quality of your resume and cover letter, but sometimes it can also be just because of plain bad luck. In some cases, your application could have just gone unnoticed through no fault of your own. Below are some of the reasons for this:</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Bad timing</b></p>  <p>You could have simply applied at the wrong time, literally. A hiring manager could have opened your email while in the middle of something and then simply forgotten about it a minute later. It does happen.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Your application was accidentally deleted</b></p>  <p>Do you ever quickly go through your email list and hold your finger down on the delete button? You&#39;re not the only one. If a hiring manager is posting advertisements on job websites, the probability of their receiving spam emails is quite high. They could have accidentally deleted your application.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Too many applications</b></p>  <p>A lot of times, hiring managers will have a stopping point for accepting applications. They either received too many or they&#39;ve already narrowed the list down to just a few candidates. Whatever the reason, they won&#39;t bother to delete the advertisement, and they might automatically delete your application. It is not uncommon, however, for them to become dissatisfied with their applicant pool. When this happens, they&#39;re not likely to review the same applicant pool from before - they&#39;ll focus on the new applicants.</p>  <p>My advice is to always try again because you never know what may happen. I am not suggesting that these scenarios happen all the time, but they do happen somewhat frequently, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt. </p>'

In the ultra competitive society we now live, a job advertisement can attract hundreds of resumes from candidates with similar set of skills and backgrounds. The recruitment process is all about finding the one perfect candidate among the basket full of candidates.  The phone interview has become a popular, flexible, inexpensive and speedy way of finding that one person. </p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Preparing for a phone interview</b></p>  <p> Before you begin your phone interview make sure that you are confident in your understanding of the position you are applying for and the company you are applying with. Do extra homework on the company&#39;s history and research recent company news. Preparation is the key and will make a great impression on your interviewers.</p>  <p>Prepare your Interview location. Make sure you&#39;re in a comfortable place with no distractions. Keep your resume in clear view, have a pen and pad to take notes and a glass of water sitting close by. Minimise any outside distractions that could potentially take your mind off the interview (HOT TIP: Disable call waiting on your phone). Dress the part so you feel and sound professional. The more professional you feel the more professional you will come across on the telephone.</p>  <p>Most importantly - Practice Interviewing. Rehearse and Practice.  There are many ways to help you prepare for the telephone interview.  Have a friend/ family member conduct an interview.  Ideally, rehearse with someone from the same industry. The best way to hear how you sound is to tape yourself. Remember the more preparation you put into the interview the better prepared you will be.</p>  <p>Preparation is the key! Write down answers to questions you believe are going to be asked. Have questions ready to go so when the interviewer says &quot;Do you have any questions to ask us&quot; you&#39;re ready and prepared.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What to do during the phone interview</b></p>  <p>Remember to Smile. Experts say that smiling puts you in a better state of mind and will project a positive image to the listener</p>  <p>Speak in a steady voice.  Don&#39;t rush what you&#39;re trying to say. Ensure that you sound enthusiastic and passionate.</p>  <p>Don&#39;t forget to breathe. It will help you stay calm and sound more relaxed.</p>  <p>LISTEN - Answer the questions which are being asked.

Do not shorten people&#39;s name. They are your potential employer not your &quot;mate&quot;</p>  <p>Take your time - Don&#39;t rush the interview. This is your time to shine.  If your feeling nervous take a moment or two to collect your thoughts</p>  <p>&quot;Cheat Notes&quot; Prepare beforehand with notes to help drive you through the interview. If the interview is going to be technical than have notes ready to prompt yourself if needed</p>  <p>Don&#39;t forget to ask questions. (For tips on the best interview questions to ask go to the &quot;Tips from the Pros&quot; page of www.redstarresume.com)</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What NOT to do during the interview</b></p>  <p>• Don&#39;t eat, drink, chew gum</p>  <p>• DO NOT SMOKE</p>  <p>• Don&#39;t interrupt the interviewer.</p>  <p>• Don&#39;t answer with just a &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;- elaborate your answers, provide examples if applicable</p>  <p>• Don&#39;t be too Casual/informal</p>  <p>• Long winded answers to questions</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>  <p>The only way to master a phone interview is to practice, be professional, and show your passion for the job role.

They can receive hundreds of applications for a single job position that they need to fill in just a short amount of time. On top of their regular job duties, they need to sift through all of the applications and find the top 5% to call in for an interview. It&#39;s just not possible for them to look at every single person&#39;s application. So what do they do? They narrow down the field by using the easiest and fastest tool they have - first impressions.</p>  <p>Let&#39;s relate this to a different topic - sports. You&#39;re a coach and need to &quot;recruit&quot; the best players possible for your team…</p>  <p>You&#39;re coaching a soccer team and need to pick 15 members for your squad out of a potential 100 and you only have 2 hours to do so. It&#39;s impossible to take a good look at every single player&#39;s skills in only 2 hours, so you need to quickly narrow your search before you can study the players further. In order to do so, and without knowing anything about the players, you&#39;re going to rely on your first impressions to make the first cut.</p>  <p>Take a look at the players standing before you - are they all wearing proper soccer attire and equipment? Do they look excited and enthusiastic about being here? Think about it - if there&#39;s someone dressed in a soccer uniform and cleats and another one wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and sandals, one of them definitely appears to be more interested in joining your team than the other. Building on that, and only considering first impressions, one looks a lot more capable than the other. While there may be a hundred explanations for this difference, it really doesn&#39;t matter when you have a limited amount of time - the ones who don&#39;t look interested are not going to make the first cut.</p>  <p>Consider the above situation and think about it from a hiring manager&#39;s point of view. You have 50 applications before you and you need to call 5 people in for an interview. You have a limited amount of time to decide, so you need to eliminate some applications quickly. What can we see without even reading the details of each application? Some have cover letters along with the resume and some do not. The applications without cover letters are a little bit like the people showing up to soccer tryouts with jeans and no equipment. They make a terrible first impression - they don&#39;t appear as interested as the other ones, so why should anyone bother with them?</p>  <p>Applications without cover letters are always the first ones discarded. The presence of a cover letter shows a genuine interest in a job position because you actually took the time to write it. The current economic climate is not exactly one that is overflowing with jobs; it&#39;s not like companies are hiring for the sake of it. Make sure you show a hiring manager that you have taken the time to merely write a letter to show your interest in their job position. If you don&#39;t bother showing an interest in them, the hiring manager will have no interest in you.</p>'

If you want to get noticed and to leave an impact, your executive resume needs to be written perfectly and professionally. In accordance with the human resources experts, there are five basic concepts on how to write the executive resume.</p>  <p>An executive resume must be able to market your skills and highlight your qualifications and experience. As an executive, it is expected that you are able to perform the duties and responsibilities. It is also expected that you have the experience in this type of role, and therefore simply listing your basic duties is not enough to stand out as an executive. The executive resume must focus on the intangible skills that you can bring to the job and it needs to reflect your visions and skills.</p>  <p>Before you sit down to write your resume, imagine that you are the person reading it. So, this implies that you need to put yourself in the shoes of an employer. For every job application, your resume needs to be targeted and directly written towards the job you are applying for. If there is a great emphasis on leadership, then the executive resume needs to highlight leadership examples and areas of your past work history where you displayed leadership, supervision and managerial expertise to lead and guide employers. Using examples and quantifiable numbers will aid your resume.</p>  <p>Rather than a broad statement such as &quot;exceeded sales targets on a monthly basis&quot;, turn this statement into an accomplishment statement that uses evidence to back up the statement:</p>  <p>&quot;Exceeded sales targets by 25% over a 12 month period while working in highly competitive markets, leading to an overall increase in expected revenue by $100,000&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>The ten steps in drafting the perfect executive resume</b></p>  <p>Step 1: The first step is to read through the job vacancy profile and begin to draft job objectives. Of course, they must be responsive to the position you are applying for</p>  <p>Step 2: Identify what knowledge, skills, and experiences will suit the job position best</p>  <p>Step 3: Create a shortlist of your qualifications and experiences that will reflect your suitability for the position</p>  <p>Step 4: Draw from your past experiences and search for accomplishments that prove you can effectively perform the job responsibilities</p>  <p>Step 5: Elaborate on your brief accomplishments that emphasize your abilities in handling the position you are applying for. It is also very important to emphasize how your work has benefited your previous employers</p>  <p></p>  <p>Step 6: Prepare your work history in chronological order, emphasizing your achievements. Concentrate on areas of how you added value to that positions (increased profit, reduced costs, implemented a new proposal, increased accuracy, project work, employee development, leadership initiatives, awards and recognition). </p>  <p>Step 7: Don&#39;t forget to list your educational qualifications, especially those that are relevant to the position. As an executive you have probably completed relevant training courses or leadership workshops that will further aid your resume application</p>  <p>Step 8: Presentation is crucial and the key is consistency!</p>  <p>Step 9: Target your resume with relevant information that will aid you in getting the job. At the executive level, the hiring manager is looking at your overall history - the tangible and intangible elements that make you an executive who can lead the business forward in a positive way. As mentioned previously, employers are looking for more than just work history when making personnel decisions at the executive level</p>  <p>Step 10: Don&#39;t forget to use strategic keywords throughout your resume and even include 10-12 keywords to highlight your key skills. Examples of strategic keywords include:</p>  <p></p>  <p>Strategic & Tactical Planning, Relationship Management, Employee Development, New Business Development, Team Building, Training and Mentoring, Client Vendor Relations, Account Retention, Lead Generation, Presentation & Negotiation.</p>'

Who hasn&#39;t!</p>  <p>Why does this happen? Do you remember back in school or university before an exam you would study hard to make sure you were well prepared and ready to answer any question that could come your way. When you buy an expensive item such as a car or house you don&#39;t just wake up one day and go to the dealership and purchase a car. You do your research. You study and become knowledgeable on the subject. Only once you have done your research and preparation do you get ready to make your purchase.</p>  <p>The same is true for your job interview. How many times have you walked into a job interview having done 5-10 minutes of preparation? Let me guess you scrolled through the company&#39;s website and re-read the job description a couple of times.</p>  <p>Finding your dream job is no game. We spend on average 40 hours a week in the office. Over the course of a single year that is 2080 hours per year. (Minus vacation, holiday time and few more &quot;personal days&quot;) When an opportunity arises to seek new employment and you are invited to the job interview you have one opportunity to shine and stand out above the other job competitors who are all vying for that one vacant position. You need to ensure that you are 100% prepared for the interview and have answers ready for every question that may come your way. To quote William Wallace in Braveheart - you have &quot;just one chance&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>So how do we know what questions are going to be asked in the interview?</b></p>  <p>The answer is we don&#39;t. There are thousands of different interview questions that may be asked. However, by planning for the interview we can be in a situation where we already have our answers ready for any type of question that a hiring manger may ask.</p>  <p>Here is my tip: The key to interviewing success is simply preparing a mental outline to follow when responding to each question. When you are sitting at home preparing for the interview, write a list of achievements, stories and examples that illustrate how you solved a particular problem or how you performed in an outstanding way. That way rather than going to the interview and thinking of your answers on the spot you will already have your mental list of answers ready to go.</p>  <p>Here is a very basic example to prove my point.</p>  <p>&quot;In my previous job I was promoted to manager after 6 months because of my hard work and dedication on a particular project ….&quot;</p>  <p>With this example in mind I am ready to answer any interview question that is related to my success and I have a story to emphasise my point.</p>  <p>Every person brings unique characteristics and value added skills to a job and as the interviewee; you need to be ready to demonstrate all the great qualities and achievements in order to succeed in your job interview.</p>'

In the meantime, your co-workers will begin to lose respect for you, which can severely hamper your chances of one day being in a situation where you become their boss. Being a good team player means acknowledging co-workers when they do good work and encouraging everyone to put their best foot forward.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Build a positive relationship with your boss not a false relationship</b></p>  <p>Just like you, your boss is only human. Yes they may have more responsibilities, but they still experience and share all the same human feelings as you will feel on a day to day basis. You do not have to be best friends with your boss, but you need to respect them and value their time. Do not try to constantly flatter them. Your boss is no fool and will quickly realise what you are doing. This can severely hurt your relationship as you will lose credibility, and in certain circumstances this can lead to them either disliking you or not taking you seriously.</p>  <p>In conclusion, a positive relationship with your boss and co-workers will make for a happy and healthy career. We spend so much of our lives at work that it is important not just to stay on our managers good side for promotion reasons, but also to ensure that we achieve maximum satisfaction from our jobs.</p>'

You want to leave the interviewer thinking that you will most certainly be a positive addition to his or her company. The last thing you want to do is to kill your chances with a simple mistake or two. While there are a number of ways to prepare for a successful interview, there are also a number of ways to quickly end your chances of getting hired. Below are some simple things to avoid during an interview:</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Showing up late</b></p>  <p>This is not only rude, but it also reflects poorly on your work ethic. Do you routinely show up late? Are you someone who can&#39;t be counted on? Don&#39;t disqualify yourself before even meeting the interviewer.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Forgetting to turn your cell phone off (or keeping it on silent)</b></p>  <p>Having a cell phone ring during an interview is not only disruptive - it&#39;s also disrespectful. While it may not be an automatic interview-killer, it certainly won&#39;t improve your chances.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Chewing gum</b></p>  <p>This looks/sounds unprofessional and tacky. No employer appreciates someone talking to them with a mouthful of gum. It&#39;s even worse if you&#39;re someone who chews loudly without even realizing.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Using &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; as a response to questions</b></p>  <p>The purpose of an interview is to provide the interviewer with more information about you. The more you give them, the better.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Using slang or profanity</b></p>  <p>This is never a positive in the workplace. Speak professionally.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Bringing up personal problems</b></p>  <p>An interview is about the job in question and about your specific qualifications, not about your personal life. While you will almost always be asked to talk a little bit about yourself, try to keep the personal talk to a minimum. Certainly don&#39;t bring up any &quot;issues&quot; that will raise red flags.</p>  <p>These &quot;killers&quot; may seem a little obvious, but they happen all the time. Avoid these mistakes and you&#39;re already ahead of a large part of the competition.</p>'

She told me that reading through every resume is almost impossible, and therefore she makes her decisions within the first 10-15 seconds of opening the resumes. If she didn&#39;t screen resumes this way, it would literally take her days upon days to read through every single application.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How to reduce 500 resumes down to the top 20</b></p>  <p>Presentation is important when it comes to resume writing. When you&#39;re reading through 500 resumes you don&#39;t want to have to search through resumes with a fine-tooth comb to find certain answers. Weird fonts, pictures and graphics make the resume harder to read and therefore increase the chance of it getting deleted. Bullet points, for example, are far easier to read than long drawn out sentences.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What you need to include on your professional resume</b></p>  <p>• Relevant skills</p>  <p>• Employment history</p>  <p>• Industry experience (depending on the job)</p>  <p>• Measurable accomplishments</p>  <p>• Professional presentation and layout</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How to ensure your resume will be deleted</b></p>  <p>• Long drawn out sentences for job duties and responsibilities</p>  <p>• Irrelevant information</p>  <p>• Lack of dates (don&#39;t make the reader have to guess)</p>  <p>• Lack of professionalism (if the resume looks like it&#39;s been written in 10 minutes, it says a lot about the candidate)</p>  <p>• Spelling mistakes</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Distinguishing between a resume that was written by a professional resume writer vs. a resume that had been written by the candidate</b></p>  <p>When you read through enough resumes, it&#39;s obvious to pick out the ones that have been written by a professional resume writer. Most of it has to do with the presentation and the format. From a hiring manger&#39;s perspective we are only interested in the information contained within the resume. We are only concerned with hiring the right person and with what they can bring to our business.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Final Point</b></p>  <p>With competition for jobs at a peak and with online job portals in greater demand than ever before, having a professionally written resume can assist in the job seeking process. The resume is one of the most important documents you will ever write as it can potentially change your life. Just remember the golden rule. Your resume is a marketing document and needs to sell your skills. Once you have achieved this you are halfway towards your new job.</p>'

Job stability seems practically non-existent. Turnover rates are at an all-time high, given the number of layoffs and agency closings. Millions of individuals are unemployed and clamouring for employment regardless of skill level. Whether you are a doctor, a chef, an engineer, a secretary, housekeeper or even a resume writer, individuals from all walks of life struggle to retain their current positions since the economic future is not promised.</p>  <p>But what route should you take if you yearn for a better opportunity or are even without a job right now? How can you ensure that your name is at least known to companies looking to fill positions? One way is to hire a resume writing expert to help ensure that your resume / CV goes to the top of the pile.</p>  <p>Let&#39;s look at it in a simple way. If you want to build a new house, you can go online, research how to build a new house and go out and buy the materials to begin building your dream house. However, as building anything is probably not your expertise and you want the house built properly the first time, it makes sense to call in a professional builder who has all the expertise and experience in building homes. The same is true of the resume writer. You can easily pick up a pen and paper and write a resume, however a resume writer can do it a lot more effectively and professionally because they have the experience, knowledge and skills in the art of resume writing.</p>  <p>The first stage of building your professional resume includes starting off with supplying the information that you wish to have printed on your document. This includes the obvious, such as your basic information (name, address, phone number, city, state and zip code). You should also be prepared to have a chronological listing of your past and current employment (if applicable).</p>  <p>It is important to have an idea beforehand of how you&#39;d like to word your list so that your job duties don&#39;t sound mundane or discredit your actual tasks. Never simply state that you were just a &quot;cook&quot; if in reality, you were a culinary arts service person!</p>  <p>Make sure your resume includes targeted keywords that leave no doubt that your past employment was productive. Stay clear of the ordinary, eliminating redundant phrases such as &quot;typed letters&quot;, &quot;filed documents&quot; or &quot;bussed tables&quot;. Yawn!</p>  <p>Most importantly, you need to use achievements throughout your resume to highlight your skills. You need to turn your basic duties into &quot;accomplishment statements&quot; and, if possible, use quantifiable results to the duties you have performed. A successful resume will highlight achievements rather than focus on responsibilities. </p>  <p>Job seeking is a cut throat business and in order to succeed your resume needs to be 100% right, and it needs to be presented and formatted professionally and correctly. When you apply for a particular job you only have one chance to succeed. Make sure that you give yourself every opportunity to get that new job!</p>'

The majority involve both cognitive and personality assessments, and can be tailored specifically to the particular position. It is also important to note that personality tests do not consist of questions which have correct answers assigned to them. What they show are personality traits that are designed to provide a deeper understanding of the candidate, as opposed to a &quot;gut feel&quot; that may be formed in an interview process, or a biased assessment from a previous employer.  Implementing both cognitive and personality testing complements and increases the validity of the assessment process.</p>  <p>At the end of the day, there are only three questions the employer really has to answer during the selection process:</p>  <p>• First, do you have the right skills and experience?</p>  <p>• Second, do you have the required enthusiasm and motivation?</p>  <p>• Finally, are you going to fit in, in terms of your personality, attitude and general work style?</p>  <p>If the answer to any one of these questions is &quot;no&quot;, the chances are that person is going to struggle down the line to fulfil their role within an organisation.

Listing salary requirements is always tricky because it&#39;s hard to &quot;guess&quot; what the employer will think about your preference. Asking for too much can rule out your chances right away because you might appear unrealistic, but asking for too little can signal a red flag and tell the hiring manager that you don&#39;t value your skills and experience. So the question is - what do you say?</p>  <p>My advice is to always include a range because you give yourself a little bit of breathing room. A range not only eliminates you from this potential scrutiny, but it could also tell the hiring manager that you need a little more information before you give them a definite answer. In other words, you leave yourself some option, and you also put yourself in a good position to negotiate. Chances are that full details of the job haven&#39;t already been provided, so if you make it to the interview and hear more about the job&#39;s requirements, you can then argue why you are qualified to receive the higher end of your salary range.</p>  <p>So how do you determine this range? Try to search for similar positions and what they offer in terms of salary. Look up job search websites and try to ballpark a range that most of the positions fit into, and then use this range when you&#39;re writing your cover letter. The range you include is entirely dependent on what you find, but I would probably suggest not making it any larger than $10,000 - it may be too general otherwise.</p>  <p>All in all, it&#39;s always best to keep your options open.</p>'

What&#39;s next?</p></p>  <p><p>If your application makes it through the screening round, the process of securing the job is likely to involve a series of interviews, initially on the telephone, followed by a number of in-person, face-to-face meetings. Many people underestimate the importance of the initial telephone conversation: the recruiter&#39;s goal is to determine your suitability for the role, so if you don&#39;t make a great first impression, you&#39;re unlikely to proceed to the next round of interviews.</p></p>  <p><p>Most of the time, you&#39;ll receive a phone call from the advertiser (this could be a Recruitment Consultant or someone from the company&#39;s HR/Recruitment team). There&#39;s usually no warning of the call, so be prepared to shift into interview mode quickly. If you happen to miss the call, it is common courtesy to return the call promptly (which is also likely to help your application).</p></p>  <p><p>While the phone interview is relatively informal, this is still an interview. A few points to consider:</p></p>  <p><p>1. Be proactive. You could consider contacting the advertiser proactively - either from the details in the advertisement or through your own research into the company. This leaves no doubt about how keen you are about the role. Not all advertisers encourage this approach, particularly for roles which are likely to attract a large volume of applicants. Be prepared to be told to apply online and don&#39;t be overly pushy if this is the case.</p></p>  <p><p>2. Don&#39;t rush. You won&#39;t be judged for taking the time to consider the question and answer it properly. Stay calm, composed and think your answers through. If you&#39;ve reached this stage, it means the recruiter genuinely wants to understand who you are and discover why you&#39;re suitable for the role. This means that even if you have a lot to say, the recruiter is unlikely to hang up on you and you don&#39;t need to worry that you&#39;re wasting their time.</p></p>  <p><p>3. Be direct in your answers. Being cagey or not giving the full answer doesn&#39;t help your cause. Remember that you are competing with other candidates and will likely to be asked the same questions as they are. Listen carefully for clues about whether your answer is on the right track. For example, if the recruiter needs more detail or is confused about your response, she may try to ask the same question in a different way.</p></p>  <p><p>4. Listen. As the saying goes: &quot;You have two ears and one mouth. Listen twice more than you speak.&quot;</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p>The conclusion of the call will usually be close when the questions end, and either a description of the role or being asked if you have any questions comes up. Simply enquiring about the next stage or a couple of questions about the role itself (team size, how this position fits into the team, etc.) will also be a good way for the interviewer to determine how keen you are and serve to leave them with a good impression. Both of which are key in hopefully securing your first stage interview.</p></p>'

I have never heard of a person who missed out on a job for having a LinkedIn account (How many people may have missed out on being headhunted for not having an active account?)</p>  <p>I recently worked with a young skilled migrant who was in the process of moving from Ireland to Australia. This individual had been granted a skilled migrant visa and was now in the process of trying to find employment before arriving in Australia. Not knowing where to begin or how to start, we began by transferring his resume into a  brand new LinkedIn profile highlighting areas such as his expertise, specialities, skills, awards, publications, education and past work history (all areas that are available to fill in on a LinkedIn profile). We optimised his LinkedIn public profile and reached out to his existing contacts asking for recommendations to add further credibility to his online profile. Last but not least we added an up-to-date professional picture (not a picture taken at 3am on a Saturday night) and uploaded this picture onto his profile. When potential hiring managers read through your profile they want to know that there is a face behind the name and adding a picture to your profile humanises the profile.</p>  <p>Now that his account had been optimised, he was now ready to network and reach out to new contacts through all the different professional groups that LinkedIn has to offer. This job seeking candidate now had a huge advantage of being able to approach people in his network and potentially open new doors that were previously closed. Rather than applying blind to a company and hoping for the best, he was able to strategically build relationships and at the same time giving himself the greatest opportunity of being identified by recruiters through his new optimised profile.</p>  <p>Remember one thing. The more relevant contacts you can build to your network the more exposure you will have to meet potential recruiters, head-hunters and employers. In the twenty first century, where social networking is booming, the LinkedIn platform can allow you to enhance your unique personal brand, connect with hiring authorities and connect with other job seekers who are in the exact same situation as yourself.</p>  <p>Networking is key!</p>'

Use your imagination and look at anything from past market shares to any philanthropy or humanitarian involvement that the company is currently engaged.</p>  <p><b>Practice Makes Perfect</b></p>  <p>The days before your interview you should research popular-asked interview questions.

More often than not you will be asked to bring in your resume and a copy of your references and so it is imperative that these people know that they may be receiving a phone call.</p>  <p><b>Prepare Your Outfit in Advance</b></p>  <p>Don&#39;t wait until the day of the interview to determine what you are wearing.  Keep in mind that you will want to pre-plan your travelling route in order to arrive at least 15 to 20 minutes early. Arriving late is the greatest mistake you can make!

	text = '<p><p><b>Competition (too few jobs and too many graduates)</b></p></p>  <p><p>Here is the scenario… You have graduated college with a good looking degree; you feel on top of the world and ready to pick and choose your dream job. The reality however is that your one of a many in the same boat. While you feel as though you would be best suited for a particular role there can be hundreds of other people who feel the same way as you. I often tell the story about my days as a recruitment consultant where I used to recruit for graduate positions. I would post a graduate position on the job boards and by lunch time I would have 200 applicants in my inbox. So what can you do to differentiate yourself from the rest of the crowd? You need to ensure that your resume is in the top 5-10% of all resumes. A single mistake in your resume can be the difference between your resume ending up in the interview stack or in the deleted folder</p></p>  <p><p><b>Downturn in the economy</b></p></p>  <p><p>We are all sick and tired of hearing about the global financial situation, sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment. Unfortunately this is the situation which new graduates find themselves facing when looking for a job. My best advice is to network, stay patient and increase the effort into the job search. You are going to have setbacks and days when you feel like the whole world is against you. The real challenge will be ones of Continuing perseverance and confidence.</p></p>  <p><p><b>Lack of Real world experience</b></p></p>  <p><p>My advice to all graduates (and those preparing to graduate) is to seek work experience. I personally hated this advice while I was at university but looking back now my work experience helped me plan out my career and gain vital experience in competitive industries. When the time came to put forward my resume, my previous work experience set me apart from many of my competitors.</p></p>  <p><p><b>Too high expectations</b></p></p>  <p><p>Many graduates (myself included) complete university and expect to hand pick the job which they want. Furthermore, graduates have an expectation that they know what is best and should actually be the boss rather than working for the boss. So many times I have had graduates apply for job positions which are so unrealistic and then get despondent because they are not getting interview requests. It&#39;s important for graduates to realize that they need to gain the experience before they can call themselves the boss.</p></p>  <p><p><b>Debate between further higher education and job seeking</b></p></p>  <p><p>Do you continue to study or start straight away with the job seeking? Many graduates don&#39;t have a choice in this matter but for those who do continuing to study can lead to greater results long term (financial and job position) and also further help distinguish yourself apart from other graduates. On the other hand is it better to start working and get your foot in the door? There&#39;s no better education then real life experience of learning on the job.</p></p>'

	text = '<p>Preparing for a job interview is tough work. You rehearse answers to common questions, decide on what clothing to wear and ensure you have done an adequate amount of research into the company. But what about the colour of your clothing - does this matter? Is wearing a white shirt with a blue tie going to help you get the job over wearing a blue shirt with a black tie?</p>  <p>Studies have shown that the colours you decide to wear in an interview can actually make a difference. In the competitive world we live in you need to ensure that you take every advantage you possibly can.</p>  <p>Different colours evoke different emotions and it is imperative when you&#39;re interviewing that you evoke the right emotions from the interviewer.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Examples</b></p>  <p>Blue: Words that describe the colour blue include: trust, loyalty, wisdom, peaceful. These are exactly the type of feelings you want to be portraying in your interview. Blue is a calming colour (Think Ocean and sky) and sends out a signal to the interviewer that you are indeed honest and sincere. Studies have shown that wearing the colour blue to an interview will increase your chances of getting hired more than any other colour.</p>  <p>Red: In contrast to the colour blue, the colour red stirs emotions more than any other colour. Red is a strong colour, very emotional, an extreme colour that in an interview scenario can work against you. Unlike blue which has a calming effect, the colour red is a fiery colour (the colour of love and passion), and can be an intimidating colour for the interviewer.</p>  <p>Orange: Similar to red. A colour that stirs emotion and therefore a colour I would avoid wearing in a job interview. Although orange is not seen to be as an aggressive as the colour red, it is still perceived as a colour that can evoke feelings of power and aggression.</p>  <p>Grey: My second favourite colour to wear after blue. Grey gives the look of sophistication and authority. In a corporate environment the colour grey is professional and portrays an individual as being confident without being intimidating.</p>  <p>Purple: The colour of &quot;Royalty&quot;. The colour symbolizes power, aristocracy, lavishness, and extravagance.</p>  <p>Black: Be careful when wearing just black to an interview.  The colour black is seen as a power colour and can be viewed as threatening. Wearing black outfits can portray an individual as being powerful or even arrogant. Black is also associated with negative implications such as death, sin, and fear.</p>  <p>Just remember that first impressions count a lot when you go to interview. Know your audience and dress accordingly.</p>'

It&#39;s a bit of harmless fun - until your intentions turn professional and you begin approaching prospective employers and contacts for a new job. Have you ever considered they might be sneaking a peek at your online profile? Can your professional network find your personal details on Facebook? Is your LinkedIn profile true to your professional resume? And, how can your online activity impact your career potential?</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>The Privacy Issue</b></p></p>  <p><p>Online privacy is a controversial issue in Australia and not just for the sporting world or celebrities! It is well acknowledged that our legislation is having trouble keeping up with the pace of new technology. Right now, unless it is considered &#39;defamatory,&#39; there is little you can do to offset the publishing of your personal information; once it&#39;s there, it&#39;s there.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p>So, should prospective employers be privy to your personal or social information? The simple answer is no; your job application should be based on merit and all other factors discounted; however if you do publish personal information on the internet and it is easily accessible, hiring managers can and might learn more than you want them to know. This includes content posted on personal websites, blogs, social sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), Twitter, old resumes and out-of-date information on professional sites and comments in forums.  Also consider content on your friends&#39; forums as on some websites your information can be viewed via the activity of others, despite your privacy settings.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>What Should You Do?</b></p></p>  <p><p>Online and social media tools can be critical to your job search, whether you are a member of niche job boards or blogs, are making the most out of career networking sites, or are receiving Twitter updates about the latest contract opportunities. However, it is important that you consider the personal/ professional divide carefully and are aware of the pitfalls of being social media savvy.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p>Not all publicity is good publicity and while you are actively job seeking, it is worth carefully considering the type of information that is out there and the potential impact of your online footprint.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>Google</b></p></p>  <p><p>Do a quick online &#39;health check&#39; by conducting a Google search on yourself.  Whatever you find is pretty much what your prospective employer will see.  If there&#39;s something potentially embarrassing or inappropriate (like that tagged photo), try to get rid of it.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p>If there is a media article that is contentious that you cannot remove, be prepared to cover it off in your interview as chances are your prospective employer has seen it.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>Facebook</b></p></p>  <p><p>Review your privacy settings.  You can determine who sees your status, photos and posts and even your political and religious views.  During your job search, it&#39;s probably a good idea to restrict all permissions to &#39;Friends&#39; only.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>LinkedIn</b></p></p>  <p><p>If you don&#39;t have a LinkedIn profile, get one, or if it&#39;s incomplete, update it. Most employers and recruiters are now using LinkedIn to find potential job candidates. A LinkedIn profile will give you the opportunity to post a professional photo of yourself, write a respectable bio, and connect with other industry professionals. Remember to make sure your profile information is consistent with your current resume.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>Blogs</b></p></p>  <p><p>A blog is an extremely effective way to demonstrate your expertise on your profession&#39;s subject matter. By posting relevant content and educated opinions, this establishes your commitment to (and interest in) your industry, builds your credibility and also enhances your chances of being found by a headhunter. A professional blog also allows you to effectively build your own &#39;brand&#39;, encourages dialogue with like-minded professionals, and gives you an &#39;industry expert&#39; reputation.</p></p>  <p><p></p></p>  <p><p><b>TOP TIPS</b></p></p>  <p><p>» Do review and adjust your social media privacy settings whilst job hunting.</p></p>  <p><p>» Do try to clean up anything that&#39;s potentially embarrassing or inappropriate.</p></p>  <p><p>» Do use professional networking sites such as LinkedIn to create a professional online profile.</p></p>  <p><p>» Do consider posting anonymously or using a &#39;nickname&#39; if you contribute to a blog or site that you don&#39;t want &#39;published&#39; professionally.</p></p>  <p><p>» Do post a decent profile picture.</p></p>  <p><p>» Don&#39;t include a link on your resume to sites or blogs which include inappropriate/ personal content.</p></p>  <p><p>By performing some basic searches and cleaning up anything that might not be appropriate for your professional network, you can avoid being discounted for a job for which you are otherwise qualified.</p></p>'

We talked to a few recruiters and found out that they frequently find mistakes so annoying that cause them to immediately discard some applications all together. Here&#39;s a sample of some of the mistakes they mentioned:</p>  <p>Letter addressed to the wrong person or company: It doesn&#39;t annoy hiring managers that you&#39;re probably applying for other jobs, but it does annoy them when you don&#39;t take the time to check that your cover letter is addressed properly. Sending it to the wrong person or company will get your application deleted immediately.</p>  <p>Spelling and/or grammar mistakes: You&#39;re probably tired of being told to check and re-check your work, but it is extremely important! When spelling or grammar errors show up on your cover letter, the person reading it is going to think that you either don&#39;t know how to write properly or that you didn&#39;t bother to check it over. Either way, it&#39;s bad news for you.</p>  <p>It&#39;s too long: Cover letters should be short and to the point. They should provide some basic information about how you are specifically qualified for the job in question. That&#39;s pretty much it. Anything longer than a few paragraphs starts to look more like an essay, and it&#39;s an immediate turn-off.</p>  <p>No contact details: It happens quite frequently - people forget to include their name, let alone a way to contact them. While your details may be on your resume, no one wants to take extra time to fish for information that should have been provided for them right away.</p>  <p>No cover letter: This is the worst mistake of all. You&#39;re competing against dozens of other applicants who have instantly shown that they took more time to apply than you.</p>  <p>At the end of the day, you just want to give yourself the best chance possible to be called for an interview.

Generally speaking, &quot;ice breaking questions&quot; are broad, yet they can be so important with how they impact the rest of your interview. Just like in a sports game, the opening minutes of the game are not where the game can be won, but where it can potentially be lost. The same goes for the interview - you are not going to get the job because of the answer you provide, but you can lose the job with your answer. Although the ice breaking question will be a general question about yourself or how your day is going, remember this is the hiring manager&#39;s first impression of you. Giving off the wrong first impression can severely affect the outcome of the interview.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Examples</b></p>  <p>• Tell me a little about yourself...</p>  <p>• Were there any problems finding our office today?</p>  <p>• Have you visited our location before?</p>  <p>• If there is a major sporting event like the Olympics going on the hiring manager may ask something along the lines of &quot;Have you been following the Olympics?&quot;</p>  <p>• Would you like some coffee or a glass of water?</p>  <p>• Are you enjoying this weather?</p>  <p>• Why have you applied for this role? (Trickier ice breaker question)</p>  <p></p>  <p>The most important aspect of answering an ice breaking question is to build early rapport with the interviewer. As I mentioned, you are not going to get the job just because you answer the ice breaking question in a brilliant way, but answering the question the wrong way can give off the wrong first impression.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Tips</b></p>  <p>Keep the answer related to the question and be brief and polite. This is not the time to tell the interviewer your life story</p>  <p>Use proper English - If you are asked how you are doing the correct answer would be &quot;Very well thank you, and how are you? or &quot;Fine thank you, how are you today?&quot; - Using slang or lazy English can create an unprofessional or even careless impression.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How to blow the ice breaking question</b></p>  <p>A colleague of mine was interviewing candidates for a new role. As a polite introduction he would ask the candidate if they found the company building ok. Most of the candidates smiled and said yes to this question. One candidate, however, told the interviewer how it took him a long time to find the building and how his train was late. He rambled on for 2 minutes about the difficulty in finding the building. Before the interview had formally even begun he had already created a negative impression on the interviewer. He had lost the job before the interview had even started.</p>'

Now that you have the job there are many tips to keeping your position and maintaining a professional image. </p>  <p>Understand your role and expectations. </p>  <p>You may feel as though you are doing a fantastic job, but if your expectations differ from those of your manager or boss, there is going to be conflict. Have a good understanding of what is expected of you. If you feel that the expectations are unrealistic, then you need to approach your boss and explain the situation. One of the most important aspects of maintaining a professional image is being a good team player and contributing fairly to the team objectives. No one likes a colleague who does not do their fair share of the work.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Expand your role and keep on learning</b></p>  <p>Be a team player and look to get involved in more areas of the business. Be willing to share your expertise, but also be willing to learn new skills. If your company offers training courses, put your hand up to get involved. If your company doesn&#39;t offer training courses, you can still take the initiative and invest in your own growth and knowledge by paying for these courses yourself. </p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Develop Positive Relationships</b></p>  <p>We all spend so much time at work that it is important to develop positive relationships with all of our co-workers, managers and bosses. Good relationships are based on trust. Keep commitments. If you promise something, make sure you deliver on time. However, if you find yourself in a situation where something has changed and you cannot keep that commitment, be honest and communicate.  Honest communication is the key to building a long-lasting relationship. </p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Be Visible</b></p>  <p>Leaving early every day and not attending social gatherings is definitely not the right way to maintain a professional image. Being visible is all part of being a good team player. This does not mean you have to be best friends with every person you work with, but there is no need to isolate yourself either.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Ask for feedback and learn from your boss</b></p>  <p>Do not be afraid to ask for feedback. In order to grow and improve ourselves, we need feedback on how we are performing in our jobs. Positive feedback is always fantastic, however don&#39;t be put down by negative feedback and certainly do not hold grudges. Learn from your mistakes and strive to do better going forward.  </p>  <p>We spend so many hours at work that we need to enjoy what we are doing. Maintaining a professional image will help you not only build a reputation of someone who is a great team player and can be counted on to add value to the business, but will also make your work life a far greater experience. When the time comes for a promotion or a pay rise, you are far more likely to be considered because of your professional attitude and image.</p>'

Recruiters and employers are looking for achievements and the value added skills you can bring to the job. Too many times a candidate will focus on the duties and responsibilities. While this is important it will not make a candidate stand out from the competition. Emphasising achievements backed up with examples is the most important part of resume writing.</p>  <p></p>  <p>2) Can you give us examples about why some resumes are never read past the first sentence?</p>  <p>There is no set rule why a particular resume may be deleted however there are many factors that can contribute to a hiring manager pressing the delete button. What every candidate needs to remember is that for every job there is potentially another 100, 200 or even 300 other candidates applying for the job. Your resume is the first impression which a hiring manger will make about a particular candidate. Using fancy fonts, long sentences, bad spelling and grammar are just a few reasons why a resume will be deleted before the hiring manager has even completed the first sentences</p>  <p></p>  <p>3) How can you make your resume stand out?</p>  <p>Professionalism is the key and targeting the resume for the job you are applying for. Remember your resume has a purpose and that is to get you an interview. It is not a pierce of artwork that will be hung on the wall. If the job you are applying for requires leadership abilities than provide examples about ways you have performed as a leader. Do not make the reader have to guess!</p>  <p></p>  <p>4) What is the number one tip to create a resume that gets the interview?</p>  <p>Achievement based resume writing</p>  <p></p>  <p>5) In your experience, what are some of the mistakes that appear in resumes?</p>  <p>The top 5 resume mistakes I see on a daily basis are as follows:</p>  <p>• The use of &quot;Text Messaging&quot; abbreviations (&quot;Going 2 c Clients)</p>  <p>• No Dates</p>  <p>• Lack of Achievements or highlights</p>  <p>• Irrelevant information (Long Winded)</p>  <p>• Spelling mistakes</p>  <p></p>  <p>6) What do you think about including a &quot;career objective&quot; statement in your resume?</p>  <p>Career objective or career summary when written well adds great value to your resume. However when written badly or &quot;generically&quot; can have a negative effect on the resume. In my opinion I like to include a career summary to introduce the candidate to the reader. It is however very important to include value added information in the career objective rather than generic information such as &quot;hard working individual who is very loyal and solve problems&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p>7) Can you give us an example of how a candidate can address gaps in their work continuity?</p>  <p>Always one of the hardest aspects of writing a resume is dealing with working gaps. A cover letter goes hand in hand with a resume and a well constructed cover letter can explain to the reader why there is a gap. I recently worked with a senior executive who took 2 years off to travel and perform community work. We included the community work on his resume to show the reader that he had been actively doing something over that certain time period and then was able to explain in the cover letter that after working nonstop for 20 years he took a 2 year break from his professional career in order to perform the community work which he had not been able to do due to his work commitments.</p>  <p></p>  <p>8) Should you include your hobbies or interests in a resume?</p>  <p>If the hobbies and interest add value to the resume than I recommend including them. If not leave them out. (Remember to target everything on your resume to the position you are going for)</p>  <p></p>  <p>9) How long does a resume have to be?</p>  <p>Resume writing is not an exact science and there is no exact answer. A standard resume will be between 2-3 pages. This is also dependent on the stage of the career a candidate is currently at. For example a graduate or young professional will typically want to have a 2 page resume. A more senior candidate may need 3-4 pages to include all of their achievements and work history.</p>  <p></p>  <p>10) Do you need to include your whole employment history or should you list only the positions relevant to the role advertised?</p>  <p>This answer is different for every candidate. Obviously a student or graduate will have fewer positions to include than a senior executive and therefore although a certain job may not be relevant to the position which they are applying for it does show the reader that they have work experience. A senior executive can afford to be more targeted and include positions related to the role.</p>'

Get to know the recruitment consultant, and follow them up weekly.

The same is true that anyone can attempt to build a house or change the plumbing or paint some artwork, however in each of these examples you&#39;d prefer to call on an expert because of their specific skills, knowledge and experience in their particular trades. The same can be said of a professional resume writer.</p>  <p>How long should a resume be? Should I include a qualifications profile or a career summary? How many duties and responsibilities should I include for my current role? Do I include the same amount of information for all my previous roles and how far back should my resume go?</p>  <p>How about questions relating to &quot;soft skills&quot; - should you include information like &quot;volunteered for the Red Cross&quot;?

If you are using these types of words do you think your competitors are as well?</p>  <p>And what about achievements - do you have any on your resume? Is a hiring manager going to take one look at your resume and be impressed with your past experiences, skills and success? Have you mentioned initiatives you introduced to the business or awards you have won?</p>  <p>This is what a professional resume writer can do for you. They can open doors to get that interview. Remember - resume writing is not about reinventing the wheel, it is about ensuring that you adequately highlight everything that is required to make sure that your resume is selected and you are given the chance to present yourself in the interview. Once you make it to the interview you have the opportunity to prove to the hiring manager how good you really are. Without a professional resume you may never get this chance.</p>'

	text = '<p>What are general interview questions?</p>  <p>Best to prepare answers to these types of questions, but do not try to memorize exact answers word for word. It will sound scripted and will be easily picked up. What you need to do is have your answers planned, but be ready to adapt or change your answers depending on how well the interview is going.</p>  <p>There are literally thousands of &quot;general interview questions&quot;. We have selected the most frequently asked questions and have given you examples of how best to answer these questions.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Tell Me About Yourself?</b></p>  <p>This is the most common question to begin the interview. It is so important that you are prepared for this question so you can give a good solid first impression before the interviewer moves onto the more challenging questions. Be careful to not to give the interviewer your life story or provide &quot;too much information&quot;. I have had candidates who have told me how they have a criminal past or how they despised their family, and this is not something you need to voluntarily bring up in an interview. Relevant facts about education and your career is all you need to be speaking about.</p>  <p>Tip: Remember to tailor your answers toward the job you are applying for. If you&#39;re applying for a role as a fashion editor for a magazine, tell the interviewer how from an early age you have always had a love for fashion and writing, and provide examples about how your passion has bought you to that interview.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Why Did You Decide To Leave Your Last Job?</b></p>  <p>Be careful!!! Do NOT (and I can&#39;t stress this enough) bad mouth your old employer. Present yourself in a positive way. It is extremely unprofessional to talk badly about your previous company, boss or peers, no matter what the reason. You also don&#39;t know if this new hiring manager knows people from your old company. The best way to answer this question is to tell them that you are looking for career advancement and you see this new company being the right career choice for you. </p>  <p>How to answer this question if you were fired:</p>  <p>TIP: If you were fired from your last job do not try to lie about it or cover it up in the interview. More than likely the company will do a background check on you anyway, so it is best to be upfront and honest. Trust me, you are not the first person to be fired. The best way to answer the question is to keep it brief and ensure the interview keeps flowing forward. Turn the negative into a positive by letting the interviewer know how you learnt from the experience and are now ready to move on.</p>  <p>Example: &quot;The job was going in a different direction to where I wanted to be going. My boss and I both thought it was best to move on to a job where I could be of greater value and offer my skills in the most maximising way.&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Where Else Have You Been Interviewing?</b></p>  <p>Don&#39;t be afraid to answer this question. The key to answering this correctly is to prove to the hiring manager that you are serious about finding a new job. This being said, you only want to mention a couple of places you&#39;ve applied to rather than going into major details. If you&#39;ve applied to many jobs, don&#39;t admit this as you don&#39;t want to come across as desperate. The aim of this question is to see if you really are seriously looking for a new job. There is nothing wrong with showing the employer that you are serious to find a new role.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What&#39;s Your Greatest Strength?</b></p>  <p>This is one of the easier interview questions, but to get the most out of your answer the best response needs to be related to the job you are applying for. IF you&#39;re an accountant and applying for an accountancy role, the best response you can give for your greatest strength is your ability with numbers, your computer skills and your attention to detail. How about if you&#39;re a dancer applying for a role? Your greatest strengths need to be balance, team work, dedication etc.</p>  <p>Rather than using generic clichéd answers such as &quot;hard-working&quot; and &quot;loyal&quot;, use this question to show the value you can add to the organisation.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What&#39;s Your Biggest Weakness?</b></p>  <p>Without doubt one of the hardest questions to answer. Being too honest can severely affect your interview. Everyone has something they can work on, so saying you have no weaknesses makes you sound arrogant. The best way to approach this is to think of a weakness that won&#39;t impact your getting the job. Remember that this question is a work-related question, so don&#39;t say that your biggest weakness is not helping enough around the house or, the worst answer I ever heard, &quot;chocolate cake.&quot;</p>  <p>Tips:</p>  <p>1)    Do not mention a weakness that will prevent you from being hired. If you&#39;re going for a job as a telemarketer, don&#39;t say your greatest weakness is speaking on the telephone!</p>  <p>2)    No clichéd responses. &quot;My greatest weakness is that I am a perfectionist.&quot;</p>  <p>3)    Do not avoid the question. The interviewer has asked you this question and you need to answer it.</p>  <p>My advice is to provide a real work-related weakness and follow it up with examples of how you are fixing the problem.</p>  <p>Example:</p>  <p>If you&#39;re asked this question, give a small, work-related flaw that you&#39;re working hard to improve. Example: &quot;I&#39;ve been told that I occasionally focus on details and miss the bigger picture, so I&#39;ve been spending time laying out the complete project every day to see my overall progress.&quot;</p>  <p>Admitting a real weakness and then following up with what you&#39;re doing to improve yourself is preferable. &quot;My presentation skills are not as strong as I&#39;d like, so I signed up for weekend presentation skills classes and also joined a Toastmasters club.&quot; Remember that the specific job you are interviewing for will help to determine how you answer the question.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Why Have You Applied For This Job?</b></p>  <p>This is a fairly innocent question and easy enough to answer. To answer this question successfully you need to show your motivation for this role, but also your desire to work for the company. Through your research into the company provide further examples why this job is the job for you.</p>  <p>Tip: Never say &quot;money&quot;!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Where Do You See Yourself In Five Tears Time?</b></p>  <p>This type of question is seeing the extent of your ambition. Be careful when answering this question not to make it seem as though this job is a stepping stone in your career (even if it is). For example, if you are applying for an accounting job at an accounting firm, don&#39;t tell the interviewer that your long term goal is to work at an investment bank. This is not what the interviewer is going to want to hear. The last thing an employer wants to do is employ you, train you and then see you leave the firm. The best answer you can offer is to demonstrate that your 5 year goals are suitable and match the position you are applying for.</p>'

It was so delicious and cooked to perfection that I only managed one piece before my friends had collectively finished off the rest of the cake. Before I baked the cake, I prepared the ingredients and even added in a few &quot;extra&quot; items to make my cake as tasty as possible. When it comes to resume writing the exact same process is required:</p>  <p>Key Ingredients:</p>  <p><b>Strategic Keywords</b></p>  <p>Using strategic keywords throughout your resume is imperative for a number of reasons. Recent reports suggest 80% of companies use some kind of software or scanning program to search for candidate resumes.  In today&#39;s society it is no longer good enough to target your job toward the role you are applying for - you also need to target your resume toward software programs that are now performing first rounds of candidate selections.  In this technological world where applying for a job can literally take a couple of clicks of a button, hiring managers are seeing hundreds of resumes (sometimes thousands) for one particular job. As much as we would like a hiring manager or recruiter to read through our entire resume, this rarely happens.  As such, using strategic keywords will help your resume rank higher and ensure that it passes the first test of being read by either a recruiter or hiring manager.</p>  <p><b>Highlighting Achievements</b></p>  <p>Resume writing and job seeking has changed a lot over the past couple of years. With new online networking sites such as LinkedIn being available and making it easier for a job seeker to network with a potential boss, highlighting your achievements on your resume and cover letter is more important than ever. When a boss or hiring manger decides to employ a new person to their staff, the first thing they want to know is how this person is going to add value to their organisation. Including basic duties and responsibilities is not enough to make you stand out as the perfect person for the job. You need to prove that you are the best person by highlighting your skills and achievements.</p>  <p><b>Presentation and Format</b></p>  <p>Your resume is the first impression a hiring manager will make about you. A well presented and structured resume that is written in a clean font will portray your resume in a professional manner and immediately give your resume application a higher ranking. Alternatively, a resume application that has spelling and grammar errors, different sized fonts, long sentences (as opposed to bullet points) and a lack of headings will not portray a positive image to the reader, and you won&#39;t look like the right person for the job. A lack of professionalism may even lead to your resume being deleted without even being read. No matter how good your skills and experience may be, once your resume is deleted, it will never be read again.</p>  <p>In order to prepare the perfect resume follow these three main ingredients. Take time to prepare your resume and ensure that you give yourself every opportunity to succeed!</p>'

Some employees indicated they were working as much as 40 additional hours per month over and above their standard working hours. Based on a Australian IT workforce of approximately 500000, and an average salary of $85000, it translates to businesses getting around $A2.6 billion of free work on an annual basis.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Greg Pankhurst, co-owner of Balance Recruitment, cited economic issues as being a key driver for the increased pressures on IT teams. &quot;IT is now a global business, and with the Australian dollar so high, outsourcing to China, the Philippines, the Sub-Continent or even Europe has never been so attractive financially. And while there are certainly challenges associated with offshoring your technical teams, the model is far more mature than it was a few years ago. If a company makes the decision to bear the additional costs and keep their IT  based in Australia, their expectations around levels of service and delivery are going to be very high.&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p>&quot;The rise of mobile devices has also been a factor. People are expecting to be available and on-line 24x7, and that in turn puts pressure on the IT team to be available 24x7&quot;.</p>  <p></p>  <p>That increased workload is coming at a cost though. Balance also asked those same people what their biggest workplace stress was, and the standout was unrealistic workloads. </p>  <p></p>  <p>Pankhurst went on to say it&#39;s important employers recognise and acknowledge the efforts of their employees.  &quot;As much as companies are under pressure, It&#39;s important to monitor the hours people are pulling and make sure that they are being recognised and rewarded for their time (be that time in lieu or additional pay). While people have accepted that they will have to put in periods of heavy work, it&#39;s very important that companies don&#39;t abuse that acceptance. It&#39;s a fine line between being a hard working environment and a sweatshop.&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p>Key Survey Questions:</p>  <p></p>  <p>Have you been asked by your employer to work overtime/weekend work with no financial reward or time in lieu?</p>  <p></p>  <p>Yes - up to 10 hrs/month - 23.1%</p>  <p>Yes - up to 20 hrs/month - 14.8%</p>  <p>Yes - up to 30 hrs/month - 3.9%</p>  <p>Yes - up to 40 hrs/month - 2.9%</p>  <p>(Total of Yes) - 50.7%</p>  <p>No - 49.3%</p>  <p></p>  <p>If you are not in a management position, what keeps you awake at night?</p>  <p></p>  <p>Stability of my role - 38.2%</p>  <p>My pay - 38.9%</p>  <p>Workplace Culture/Management - 39.6%</p>  <p>Workload - unrealistic deadlines - 51.8%</p>  <p>Career growth/lack of challenges - 50.2%</p>'

Too many times candidates cause themselves heartache and misery because they have unrealistic expectations when applying for jobs. Yes, it&#39;s true you need to aim high, but aiming too high can just lead to a longer time of being unemployed. I recently met a candidate who told me they had applied to over 100 banking jobs, but had not received a single interview request.</p>  <p>The first thing I did was review his resume as a poorly written resume is usually the reason behind 90% of failed attempts at securing interviews. The resume is the first impression a hiring manager has, so if there&#39;s something fundamentally wrong with it, it doesn&#39;t matter how good your qualifications are if the resume is never going to be read.</p>  <p>This time, however, his resume was very well written. His achievements were highlighted and the resume was structured and well presented, so I was quite confused as to why he was not getting a single interview. As a job seeker with 2 years of relevant work experience there didn&#39;t seem to be a reasonable reason why this candidate should not be getting interviews or job offers.</p>  <p>The next thing we did was sit down together and analyse the jobs he had applied for, and there was the answer.</p>  <p>Within 60 seconds it became obvious why he wasn&#39;t getting any interview requests. With 2 years of experience and on a base salary of $50,000, he was applying for senior roles with base salaries of $80,000-$120,000. With many of the jobs he didn&#39;t even tick the essential requirements on the job description such as minimum years in a manager position.</p>  <p>Not only was he wasting his own time by applying for these positions, but he was also causing unnecessary stress and anxiety in the meantime. I encourage candidates to strive for bigger and greater jobs and to seek out higher salaries, but just remember to be realistic in your job search. To be a manager or in a senior role takes experience and it is very unlikely that a company will hire an outside person to fulfil a role without the relevant experience. The more likely scenario is the company will promote within the company.</p>  <p>Go for gold and strive to succeed, but just remember to be realistic with your job expectations.</p>'

When you start off with &quot;My name is…&quot; a hiring manager is immediately going to think that he or she is about to read a life story, and they won&#39;t be particularly interested.

Instead, you need to focus on why you are writing this letter, and stick to just that.</p>  <p>It&#39;s important to keep cover letters short and very straight-forward. Hiring managers are very busy and they don&#39;t have time to read more than a few short paragraphs. Your writing needs to be engaging and interesting; you want the reader to feel compelled to read the entire thing - you don&#39;t want them to get turned off immediately. Hiring managers tend to skim through cover letters quickly, so it&#39;s important to highlight the most important details: why you are contacting them and why you are qualified. They aren&#39;t interested in much more, so make sure you keep it simple.</p>  <p>Your goals (in addition to eventually getting hired) are to have your resume read and to be called in for an interview, so try to use all the tools you can to make that possible.

Having brains is always an advantage, but it&#39;s not the only thing that hiring managers are looking for. In today&#39;s economy, an employer wants to know that, if required, you are able to complete a wide range of jobs. Having transferrable skills, a can do attitude and a willingness to learn and be involved in all aspects of the business is key to nailing the job interview.</p>  <p>#2: Direct experience is most important</p>  <p>Transferable skills are key. In certain industries the job specification may require direct experience, but in many circumstances being able to show that you have the skills to succeed is just as important. Do not get discouraged if you feel that you lack the right skills to get a new job. Concentrate on the value added skills that you have and highlight these skills on your resume and in the job interview.</p>  <p>#3: Dating a co-worker will lead to career doom</p>  <p>An urban myth. I have even heard of stories where dating the boss has resulted in career success (not recommended!). Always remember to perform your role to the highest quality and it does not matter who you decide to date! (Note - public displays of affection are a big no no! - this type of behaviour is best saved for non-work hours).</p>  <p>#4: Applying for jobs online is the only way to find a new job</p>  <p>Job searching online is one of many different approaches you should take. Before you even begin to apply for jobs, ensure that you have a professionally written resume. No matter how many jobs you apply for, it doesn&#39;t matter if your resume is not selling your skills. With the growth of social networking online, sites such as LinkedIn can be a fantastic way to approach people who you typically could not just pick up the phone and call.</p>  <p>#5: Writing a cover letter is a waste of time</p>  <p>Every time you apply for a job you should accompany your resume with a targeted cover letter. The only exception is when the job specification clearly states not to send a cover letter. Most times a hiring manager will read your cover letter before opening your resume. If your cover letter does not shine, there is a good chance your resume won&#39;t even be opened.

He was at the top of his class and as a recent graduate, he was now looking at beginning his career in one of the top law firms. Every job this candidate applied for was right for him. A recent law graduate seeking the best and brightest. The candidate sent his resume out to every law firm in the city and didn&#39;t receive one interview request. Even the smaller firms were not even giving him a chance.</p>  <p>Here&#39;s what I saw when I took a brief look at his resume. The candidate had put his education and university roles on page 3 of the resume and had devoted the first 2 pages of the resume to the part-time jobs he had during high school and university. As such, by the time the hiring manager had read through page one of his high school work experience, the resume was being deleted before the most important part of the resume (his education) was even read. In today&#39;s society, reports suggest that a job candidate has 15-20 seconds to catch the reader&#39;s attention. By putting the most important information on the back page of the resume, the reader&#39;s attention was focused on aspects of the resume that were completely irrelevant for the candidate in getting the job.</p>'

Applicants used to send hard copies of their resumes and cover letters to hiring managers via email or fax, but most jobs today are posted online and applications are sent to hiring managers via email.</p>  <p>Applications still consist of cover letters, but the format of cover letters has changed a little bit in the online revolution. Cover letters used to be written in a standard letter format, and while this standard format is still widely accepted today and is by no means wrong, a lot of people are adapting their cover letters to complement the use of email in the application process.</p>  <p>One thing I always encourage people to do is to place their cover letter in the body of their email in addition to attaching a copy. I suggest this for 2 reasons. One, it speeds up the process for the recruiter (as they will only have to open up one attachment instead of two) and two, it helps eliminate the possibility (in the recruiter&#39;s mind) that your email could be spam. Think about it - if you received an email with attachments, you would be more likely to open the attachments if there were some personalized text in the body. There will also be times where the recipient is unable to open your resume attachment, and they are much more likely to respond and request another copy if there is some text in the body of your email.</p>  <p>I do also suggest that you ALSO include a copy of your cover letter as an attachment just in case the recruiter would like to print it and show it to people.</p>  <p>In the grand scheme of things, these suggestions seem pretty minute, but with the competition as high as it is right now, why not pull out all the stops?</p>'

It seems to me that these warnings are given out all the time. When I ask people to tell me the number one mistake on a resume, they almost always say that it&#39;s bad spelling and/or grammar. This really makes me wonder because it&#39;s pretty rare that I come across an error-free resume. There always seems to be something, whether it&#39;s a misspelled word or a missing comma. The best explanation I can come up with is that people today seem to rely a little too much on spell and grammar check programs.</p>  <p>Spelling and grammar check programs are great in many ways, and they seem to pick up a lot of common mistakes. For example, they automatically add apostrophes to words like &quot;can&#39;t&quot; when you forget to put one in there. Or they might automatically capitalize the word &quot;I.&quot; They also do a good job at highlighting some clearly misspelled words. Despite all of these benefits, however, programs like these should not be seen as flawless. There are tons of things they can miss, and below are a few examples:</p>  <p>Same word, different spelling: Some words sound exactly alike, but have different spellings with entirely different meanings. Spell check will not pick up when these words are used improperly. These words could include: then, than, your, you&#39;re, too, to, two, their, there, are, our… and this is only naming a few.</p>  <p>Word choice: Did you know, for example, that the words &quot;which&quot; and &quot;that&quot; can not exactly be used interchangeably?</p>  <p>Punctuation: Comma omissions and unnecessary commas are usually not picked up.</p>  <p>Overall structure of your resume: Is your resume written in past or present tense? Or are the tenses all over the place? Consistency is something these programs won&#39;t notice.</p>  <p>I&#39;m not saying that you shouldn&#39;t use these programs - they are useful in many situations. I&#39;m saying that you shouldn&#39;t rely solely on them to check over your resume because they aren&#39;t foolproof. It&#39;s important to check and re-check it yourself and to then also show it to a couple of friends and see what they can find. We sometimes rely on computers to do too much for us, and we forget that they aren&#39;t even close to flawless. Don&#39;t underestimate the capabilities of the human eye.</p>'

	text = '<p>My philosophy is simple:  Stick to the facts. If in doubt, leave it out!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Abbreviations</b></p>  <p>Avoid abbreviations! They are unprofessional and not universally accepted.  Trust me; nothing looks worse on a resume than seeing sentences resembling the following: &quot;duties included answering the fone and going 2 c clients.&quot; This is a resume, not a text message. Make sure you use correct words and proper sentences.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>  <p>Leave off anything related to hobbies or personal interests. If it doesn&#39;t relate to employment it doesn&#39;t belong on a resume. Information such as weight and height is irrelevant (unless of course you&#39;re trying out for basketball team). I have seen resumes where people include their eye colour and comments about their skin (&quot;glowing skin&quot;). Do not give the reader a reason to eliminate you because of your personal characteristics.  Again, stick to the formula - if it does not relate to the job it doesn&#39;t belong on the resume.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Graphics / Artwork</b></p>  <p>People feel that in order to be noticed they need their resume to look like a piece of artwork. This perception is wrong and has the opposite effect of appearing unprofessional and amateur. At the end of the day, the employer only wants to see skills, duties, and achievements. He or she is not interested because your resume is shaded yellow with a butterfly in the top right-hand corner.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Negativity</b></p>  <p>Never, never, never be negative on your resume or cover letter (and most importantly, in your interview). If you left your previous job because you hated your boss, keep it to yourself. Do not try to explain this on your resume because you cannot explain those reasons in writing.  Remember, a resume&#39;s job is to promote and sell. Do not get eliminated immediately for being negative.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>No Dates</b></p>  <p>DO NOT MAKE THE READER HAVE TO GUESS! This is such a killer on any resume. INCLUDE DATES. What years did you go to high school? How long did you go to university? When did you graduate? How long did you work at your current job?</p>  <p>Do not make the person reading your resume have to ask these questions.  The minute this happens, your resume is going to one place—the trash bin! Make sure your resume flows and you have no gaps in your dates. If you took a year off to go travelling, include this. When you include dates DO NOT just include years. For example, &quot;I worked at McDonalds from 2006-2008&quot;- what does this mean? Did you work for 3 from January 2006 to December 2008, or for a little over 1 year from December 2006 to January 2008.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Long-winded</b></p>  <p>Long long long long long resumes are boring!!!!  If an employer sees an extremely long resume, they will immediately develop a negative frame of mind. Remember, resume readers tend to have little patience, especially when they need to read 100 resumes. You do not gain extra brownie points for writing the longest resume—enough said!</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Lack of achievements / highlights</b></p>  <p>I never understand how people get this wrong, but so many times people fill up their resumes with irrelevant information, and they leave off the most vital part of a resume—showing off your highlights and achievements. Think about it—most people who apply for the same job can all do the standard day to day duties. So what separates the good resume from the bad resume? It&#39;s the one that includes achievements and highlights. It includes how they were an asset at their previous job. Employers want to see not that you just worked and did a good job, but that you added value to the company.  Leaving off your achievements is the best way to get your resume tossed in the bin. Alternatively, including value-added achievements is the best way to get your resume put on the top of the list.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Irrelevant information</b></p>  <p>Everyone is proud of achievements they have accomplished throughout their life. Finishing second place in the 100 metre sprint final in my first year of high school was a great thrill, but is it relevant on my resume? Does it add value to it? Use common sense when including &quot;extra information.&quot; Receiving your CPR certificate is relevant when you&#39;re applying for a job that requires this, such as a lifesaver or swimming instructor. It isn&#39;t so relevant if you received your CPR certificate 10 years ago, and now you&#39;re going for a job as a CEO.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Grammar mistakes and typos</b></p>  <p>People read this point and think, &quot;Obviously my resume isn&#39;t going to have spelling mistakes and typos.&quot; I can tell you from experience that 1 in 5 resumes will make this vital mistake. When an employer has 100 resumes, the first 20 are eliminated because of grammar mistakes or typos. These mistakes are glaringly obvious on a resume. Make sure you use spell-check, but more importantly, re-read your resume. Even give it to someone else to read over.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Trying to sound &quot;Too Clever&quot;</b></p>  <p>You may think that using words such as &quot;meticulous,&quot; &quot;scrupulous&quot; or &quot;industrious&quot; to describe yourself may make you sound smart, unfortunately they can have the opposite effect. Your resume is a representation of you. Don&#39;t forget this!</p>  <p></p>'

I was right. They soon started talking about their respective workplaces.</p>  <p>I became further intrigued as they tried to convince each other that they should jump ship to each others&#39; firms. The first man worked at a well respected global investment bank which he said was expecting a &quot;big year&quot; in 2011. On the flip side, this meant more time away from his family.</p>  <p>The second guy worked for a boutique bank. He was happy that his travelling days were behind him but moaned about the lack of training that his company was providing to new hires, especially at graduate level. He was spending a lot of time working one-on-one with new employees, which he wasn&#39;t happy about.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Working out the benefits</b></p>  <p>The man from the global IB mentioned a new gym membership for all employees but said with his hours, working out was not on the agenda. His friend didn&#39;t get this benefit but had vowed to work fewer hours this year to make more time for himself and his family.</p>  <p>Listening to both men got me thinking about the pros and cons of large banks and niche ones. While the fundamentals of your work will be the same, the application of that work can vary.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Where everybody knows your name</b></p>  <p>The major difference I think is culture. Employees in a boutique are more like family and the whole firm knows your name. In a big bank you probably only interact with members of your team and know little about other people and their duties.</p>  <p>A boutique can therefore have a friendlier feel to it and people work together rather than competing against each other. You have a strong support network, which can be accessed a lot easier than at a larger institution.</p>  <p>Working for a big bank typically means you have one distinct job function, while at a smaller company you are often exposed to several different roles based on current projects. With less hierarchy and fewer processes, boutique employees have a greater chance to expand their knowledge. Being part of a smaller team can also let you stand out and be recognised for your contribution.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Size sometimes matters</b></p>  <p>However, the prestige of working for a large, well respected bank can be a huge advantage, and you will get fantastic perks and benefits. Although there is a feeling of being small fish in a large pond, having a specific role that you are solely responsible for can provide better future opportunities if you want to process your career in that job function. Training opportunities are generally much greater and more highly regarded by potential employers.</p>  <p></p>  <p>Overall, you need to find the right firm for you, based on factors such as those above. And no matter where you&#39;re working, the atmosphere will be demanding. That&#39;s the very nature of the banking industry - it&#39;s a sink-or-swim culture.</p>'

No matter how good your achievements, skills, experience and knowledge if the hiring manager has not found them within 10 seconds than your resume will be deleted - and once it is deleted from the inbox it will never be read again.</p>  <p>Your resume is a marketing document - it&#39;s your marketing tool to sell yourself. First impressions count for a lot and if your resume is being deleted than it will be impossible for you to get the job</p>  <p>Do the small things right and your already half way there to your new job!</p>'

	text = '<p><b>Why Should We Hire You For This Job?</b></p>  <p>The reason they should hire you is because you&#39;re best person for the job because of your skills and competence and also because of the enthusiasm you will bring to the role. You can be assured that 90% of the candidates will start pitching their skills and achievements, but what makes you stand out more is your enthusiasm and passion for the role. When describing your skills and achievements, relate them to the job description and give reasons why you would add value to the business. When pitching yourself, remember the importance of body language. Sit up in your chair and be positive.</p>  <p>Tip: Prepare for the interview by taking the job description and write down the skills you bring to each description and examples of accomplishments and achievements. Having examples ready to go can really help you when answering this question.</p>  <p>Example answer: (applying for a sales position)</p>  <p>&quot;With my 5 years of work experience I have developed, maintained and expanded customer relationships, positioned new products to drive sales growth and developed new marketing strategies to ensure sales targets are exceeded and market share increased. I have expertise in the implementation of account strategies, tactical sales and marketing plans. As you can see my sales records speak for themselves, and in my previous role I was awarded for consistently exceeding sales and profit targets. Most importantly, I am extremely passionate about what I do and have a love for sales.&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Do You Work Well Under Pressure?</b></p>  <p>This is an easy question to answer if you have done your research and prepared for this question. (Tip - telling the employer that you crumble under pressure and burst into tears is not going to help you get the job). Although this is a closed question and can be answered with a one word answer, always provide an example of a time where you worked under pressure and how you rose above the pressure to succeed.</p>  <p>Tip: It may seem obvious, but keep the example work-related. I have interviewed a young man who told me that he kicked the winning goal with only one minute left on the clock. It may have been an example of working well under pressure, but what I was really asking for was a work-related answer.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How Do You Handle Change?</b></p>  <p>This is a classic interview question that always makes a candidate think! It is incredible the amount of times a candidate will say &quot;I handle change well&quot; before an awkward silence as they try to think about an example. Change is natural part of life and it is about adapting to change that makes you a stronger person. Choosing to embrace change is an opportunity for personal growth.</p>  <p>The best answer is that you embrace change rather than opposing change out of fear or routine. No matter what the job throws at you, you&#39;re able to handle it. Provide an example of where you were able to handle change and come out stronger as a result.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Briefly Describe Your Ideal Job?</b></p>  <p>This is a &quot;curve ball&quot; question. My ideal job would be earning a million dollars a week and only working about 3-4 hours a day. Perhaps my ideal job is playing first base for the New York Yankees. Either way, neither of these answers is right. The right answer to this question is to keep it in line with the characteristics of the job and company you are interviewing with. Concentrate on your strengths and what you best bring to the job. A sample answer would be along the lines of, &quot;My ideal job is where I can utilize my key strengths including X, Y, and Z and as a valued member of the team make a positive and significant contribution.&quot;</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What Makes You Want To Work Hard?</b></p>  <p>This is a good question from the interviewer&#39;s perspective, but also an easy question to answer if you&#39;re prepared. If we were to answer this question in a court room under oath a large percentage of people (myself included) would naturally say material rewards, higher salary, big bonus, perks etc. Luckily we are not in a court room. Focus more on being part of a successful team, adding value to the organisation and the satisfaction you derive from it.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How Would Your Co-Workers Describe You?</b></p>  <p>This is a time for you to show off the attributes that make you unique and further convince the interviewer that you are the right person for their organization. This question is designed for you to put forward your strengths, but remember there is a difference between pride in how you believe you&#39;re perceived and arrogance. Answers such as &quot;My co-workers think I am wonderful&quot; or &quot;They think that I am the greatest thing since sliced bread&quot; do not go down well in interviews. As per every good answer, provide examples of accomplishments you have achieved.</p>  <p>Power Words</p>  <p>Attentive, Direct, Committed, Conscientious, Dynamic, Hard Worker, Persistent, Methodical, Motivated, Objective, Tenacious, Sociable, Reliable, Resourceful, Respectful, Creative, Confident, Trustworthy</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What Motivates You?</b></p>  <p>This is a great interview question and a question that every potential job seeker should ask themselves while preparing for the interview. The right answer is providing a mixture of what motivates you as a person and what motivates you about the job you are applying for. Remember to be specific and tailor your answer to the job you are applying for.</p>  <p>Question: Do you mention money or not?</p>  <p>Typically saying that money or benefits motivates you is not the response a hiring manager is looking for. But as per always, the rules change depending on what industry you are applying for. For example, if you are applying for a sales role that offers high commission, being motivated to succeed and earn greater commission is definitely a motivation. Rather than just saying money motivates me (which is not advised), tell the interviewer that you are motivated to sell and succeed and enjoy working in an environment where the more you put in, the more you can gain in return.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>What Are Your Salary Expectations?</b></p>  <p>It goes without saying that everyone wants to make as much money as possible. The best way to answer this question is by researching the market value of the job you are applying for. Honesty is the best policy when it comes to salary expectations because if you are looking for a role that pays 60,000 but the role will only pay 40,000, it won&#39;t be long before you begin to lose interest in the role and start searching all over again for a new job. Show the hiring manager that you have thoroughly researched the role and have an understanding of how much the role pays. Many people try to avoid giving the interviewer a straight answer when answering this question as not to &quot;rock the boat&quot;.</p>  <p><b>The Worst Answer is a &quot;Desperate Answer&quot;.</b></p>  <p>Example Question: What are your salary expectations for this job?</p>  <p>Example Answer: &quot;I&#39;m easy - whatever you guys are willing to pay.&quot;</p>  <p><b>A Good Answer is a &quot;Researched Answer&quot;</b></p>  <p>Example Question: What are your salary expectations for this job?</p>  <p>Example Answer: &quot;From my research, I know that the salary range for this position is between $60,000 and $70,000 - having worked in the industry for 5 years I feel that my value would fit into this range&quot;.</p>'

	text = '<p>I recently came across a resume that listed a summer cashier position in 1976 as part of a person&#39;s &quot;professional experience.&quot; While it may seem a little strange or ridiculous to include an irrelevant position from nearly 25 years ago, I can tell you that it&#39;s actually not that uncommon to come across something like this. A lot of people think that they literally need to include everything they&#39;ve ever been involved with on their resumes, and I can assure you that not only do you not have to follow suit, you also don&#39;t really need to go back any longer than 10 years.</p>  <p>The main goal of your resume should be to impress the reader with the specific qualifications and experiences that make you fit to be hired for a desired position. That being said, the reader is most interested in what you have done recently, not in what you did over 10 years ago. The bulk of your resume should be devoted to the last few years of your working history - this is what potential employers want to know about.</p>  <p>If you&#39;re like most people, you&#39;ve probably held a number of jobs over time if you include the part-time and casual positions. If wrote a little bit about each one of these, your resume would probably near the 4 page mark on experience alone. Considering it shouldn&#39;t be longer than 2 pages, this is far from ideal.</p>  <p>When it comes to listing your professional experiences, stick to the most recent and relevant positions. There is no need to include everything, and writing about too much will sometimes blur your positions together and detract from your real qualifications. Unless you&#39;ve held the same position for over 10 years, there is really no reason to go back any longer than this, and employers don&#39;t even expect to go back that far on your resume anyway. If you do have quite an extensive work history of relevant positions, focus on the most recent ones and then simply list the earlier positions under a new category for &quot;previous or other employment.&quot;</p>  <p>Just remember that there is such a thing as &quot;too much&quot; on a resume. Focus on what the hiring manager wants to see, not on how much information you can cram onto it.</p>'

	text = '<p>What should you NOT do in an interview? A poll into interview blunders found that when hiring managers were asked to name the most common and damaging interview mistakes a candidate can make, 51% listed dressing inappropriately.  49% percent cited badmouthing a former boss as the worst offense, while 48% said appearing disinterested.  Arrogance (44%), insufficient answers (30%) and not asking good questions (29%) were also top answers.</p>  <p>Below is a top 10 selection of mistakes to avoid. A big part of a successful interview is avoiding simple mistakes. Mistakes are deadly to the job seeker and easy to avoid if you are prepared:</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Arriving Late</b></p>  <p>Get directions from the interviewer - or look up the location on a man. Wear a watch, and leave home early. In the extreme case that you cannot avoid being late, call the interviewer and arrange to reschedule.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Lack of Preparation</b></p>  <p>Not being prepared is just about the biggest mistake you can make when it comes to job interviews. You need to prepare for an interview in the same way you would prepare for an exam.  When you are offered an interview, make sure you ask what form the interview is going to take so you can prepare. E.g. is it going to be a one on one interview? Will it be a group interview? Who will be attending the interview, and what are their positions? Not being able to answer basic interview questions such as &quot;What do you know about this company?&quot; creates the impression that you don&#39;t care, and it can end your chances immediately.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Dressing Inappropriately</b></p>  <p>You make your greatest impact on the interviewer in the first 10 seconds, and you want that first impression to be strongly positive. Dress for the occasion. You will certainly need to wear a suit if you are interviewing for professional position. When interviewing for another type of job, such as a casual summer job as a lifeguard or waitress, for example, dress accordingly in neat and casual attire.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Badmouthing</b></p>  <p>This includes badmouthing your current or former employers, employees or even the competition. Nobody likes a complainer and it portrays a negative image of your personality. In the world we live in, you never know who your interviewer might be friends with or who the company&#39;s clients are. You don&#39;t want the interviewer to think that you might speak that way about his or her company in the future.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Poor body language</b></p>  <p>• Mumbling</p>  <p>• Using constant slang</p>  <p>• Crossing your arms</p>  <p>• Rigid</p>  <p>• Slouching</p>  <p>• Nervous gestures e.g. playing with your hair</p>  <p>• Using your hands too much when talking </p>  <p>• Don&#39;t be rude or abusive</p>  <p>You would expect this to be obvious, however an interviewer will want to test your patience and see how you react to their questions. Losing your temper, becoming defensive, and acting abusive are the best ways to not get hired. No matter how calm or apologetic you are, the damage has already been done.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Poor Communication Skills</b></p>  <p>This includes answering questions with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers. You need to display confidence. Engage the person you are speaking with, and let the interviewer know that you are an excellent candidate for this position.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Talking Too Much</b></p>  <p>The interviewer wants to know why you are the best person for the job. They do not need to hear your entire life story. There are few things worse than interviewing someone who goes on and on and on.  Keep your answers concise, to-the-point, and focused. Don&#39;t ramble, and don&#39;t lie or make up stories. The best advice is to be honest and simply answer the questions. </p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Not answering the question</b></p>  <p>Nothing is more frustrating for an interviewer than to ask a simple question and not get an answer. Straight away it sets off alarm bells in the interviewer&#39;s head that the person is either unprepared or not listening. Make sure you listen to the question and take a moment to gather your thoughts before you respond.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Forgetting to Follow Up</b></p>  <p>No matter how well you think the interview went, always follow up. If you have not heard from the interviewer within a few days, don&#39;t be afraid to call and follow up and reiterate your interest in the position. A follow up thank you email or phone call can sometimes go a long way to securing you the job. It also leaves a good impression</p>'

	text = '<p>When you hear the saying &quot;a picture tells a thousand words&quot;, this means that a picture can tell a story just as easily as a large amount of text. The same is true about your professional CV. Your CV can tell the reader a lot about the type of person you are and the type of worker you will be.</p>  <p>During one of my earliest roles as a recruiting agent, I was asked to find a shortlist of 5 candidates to fulfill a HR position. The position was an entry level role for a very well known and respected investment bank and although the client had instructed several requirements that they wanted in the right candidate (e.g. Bachelor Degree), the most important aspect was to find a candidate that would be the &quot;right fit&quot; for this company.</p>  <p>We began our search for the candidate by placing a job advert in one of the online job portals. Within 3 hours we had over 150 CVs sitting in our inbox. By the end of the day we had another 400 CVs (at that stage we decided to take the job advert of the Internet). With our client urgently calling us wanting to know how soon they would receive CVs of potential candidates, we had the task of trying to sort through the huge amount of CVs and find the top 5 candidates.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>How to stand out from the competition</b></p>  <p>First impressions count! It is estimated that a hiring manager or recruitment agent will spend no more than 15 -30 seconds reading through your CV before either deciding to continue reading or pressing delete. Unfortunately there is not one secret that will guarantee your CV will stand out from the competition, but there are many factors that will get your CV deleted. In my experience the first thing I look for in a CV is professionalism.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Spelling Mistakes and bad grammar</b></p>  <p>It is an unforgiveable sin to have any spelling errors on your CV . Spelling mistakes and bad grammar send out a negative signal that that the candidate is careless, does not take pride in his or her work and lacks the professionalism that the client demands. Without even reading through more of the CV I would delete this CV.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Layout and Presentation</b></p>  <p>It is an undisputed fact that if a hiring manager has two CVs sitting on the table, they are instinctively going to be drawn to the CV that is professionally presented and easy to read. No matter what the CVs say, the first impression is already made. If both candidates share similar skills and experiences, just take a guess at which CV the hiring manager is going to choose.</p>  <p>When you sit down to write your CV, remember one thing. Your CV is your representation. This 2-3 page document is all you have to prove to the hiring manager that you are the right person for the job.  Present a professional picture and make sure that you stand out above your competition.</p>'

Sure, you might not have direct experience in a certain industry or job, but you need to prove to any hiring manager that your existing skills are, in fact, transferable skills.</p>  <p>If you&#39;re debating about making a career change, don&#39;t be afraid. Even if a career switch later in life seems like a completely radical change with many possible consequences attached to it, you should still go for it if it&#39;s something you really want to do. My best advice is to set up a plan before making the dive. A large-scale transition will not happen overnight, and this is why it&#39;s important to ensure you have a &quot;plan of attack.&quot;</p>  <p>Also, make sure your career change is realistic. Although I encourage everyone to follow their dreams, you also need to stay realistic. If your dream is to become a pilot, but you&#39;ve worked in banking for the last 15 years, the chances of you becoming a pilot are a lot harder (but not impossible)! Also remember to be flexible. You are making a career change that could involve a lower salary or relocation. These are some of the sacrifices you could be asked to make in the short term.</p>  <p>When you begin applying for new roles, you need to ensure your resume is targeted toward this new job. Obviously you are not going to have direct experience, so it&#39;s important to highlight not only your current skills and achievements, but also (and most importantly), that you are able to adapt your skills for this new job.</p>  <p>In making the career change, your skills are by far your best selling point. Many skills that you use on a day to day basis (such as leading, managing, liaising and communicating, for example) are all transferable skills that you can use to prove to a hiring manager that you are right for a particular job.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>5 point plan to making a career change</b></p>  <p>1) Make sure of your reasons for wanting a career change. One bad day at work or hating your boss do not suggest you want to change careers</p>  <p>2) Brainstorming - sit down and brainstorm ideas of the type of industry/job you really want to do</p>  <p>3) Planning - Set out a plan to follow. Make it realistic. Remember your career change won&#39;t happen overnight. Realistically, it can take about 6-12 months. Don&#39;t quit your job on day 1. Included in planning is financial planning. How much is this career change going to cost you? How much do you plan to get paid? You need to know these answers!</p>  <p>4) Networking - Talk to friends, speak to recruitment agents and sign up to online networking sites</p>  <p>5) Executing your plan. Speak to an expert in regards to interviewing, resume writing and cover letter writing. Apply directly, and begin to follow the steps of your plan.</p>'
