If your boss is one of many managers and you might be able to be moved then I think you need to be objective about why you&#39;re having issues with that person and look at them unemotionally. Try and ask some peers about what they think about how... Try and look at yourself, first of all, and wonder why you have this animosity between you and your boss, what can you do about it.</p>  <p>And if you look at all those things and you really feel there&#39;s nothing you else can do in that relationship, then I think you&#39;ve seriously got to think about talking to someone more senior, talking to the Human Resources people about the issues you&#39;ve got with that person, and asking them for guidance. And maybe you get moved to another area or another section in the business, maybe that person&#39;s got issues with you, that you might have done something that they&#39;ve sort of harboured, that&#39;s coming across as really negative vibes towards you, so may be both of you need to be counselled.</p>  <p></p>  <p>But I think sitting there doing nothing is no good, just saying &quot;I&#39;m leaving&quot; is no good. Because why should you leave a company because you hate your boss? Ok? So, have a look at it, trying to get the objectivity into it rather than the emotional feelings we all get when we got that sort of a clash of personality, and bring in where you can Human Resources people or more senior management to try and talk to that person because usually when you get to the point where you hate your boss, there&#39;s not a lot of chance of you and them working that out yourself, you need someone else to help you.</p>'

I, if I&#39;m looking at time management, and we&#39;ve talked a bit about time management, my perfect model for a great time manager is a mother working with a child or children.</p>  <p>If you ask them what they do and how they manage their day and their week, they get out of bed very early, they do all these things they do play lunch and lunch and get everything ready, get their husband out of bed usually, get them going, drop the kids at daycare or school or wherever it is and then get to work. And they go home again and they usually cook dinner and get everything organised for the kids for school the next day.</p>  <p>So if you want a good time manager, a working mother is one of the best you can get.</p>  <p></p>  <p>So, I&#39;m a great fan of women returning to work, only because of my philosophy.</p>  <p>But I think the first thing they should do is to feel that they&#39;ve been doing a worthwhile thing. That&#39;s a very important thing. They haven&#39;t lost the skills they had before they had their child. Those skills are still there. And a working mother doesn&#39;t have to be totally disconnected. There&#39;s the Internet these days, there&#39;s magazines, and newspapers. They can keep up to date, and they can also once they&#39;ve decided to go back to work, they can do a bit of a ramp up, if you like, on what the business community has been doing and the target organisations that they&#39;re looking to go and join, they can start to research that organisation, upgrade their knowledge and skills about what the company has been doing.</p>  <p>So they can get themselves on the runway early with knowledge and information.</p>  <p>And it&#39;s very easy to research companies these days, and it&#39;s very easy to look a bit historical about what they&#39;ve been doing while they might have been out of the workforce.

So that&#39;s one of the big time wasters, just say you&#39;ve got be really strong, put your hand up, communicate to that other work person that &quot;I can&#39;t talk to you now, I&#39;m focused on doing this&quot;. And measure your time, measure what your outputs are, and the time you put into those things.</p>  <p>So, just good time management is the best way to get good work-life balance because you weave into your diary through the week, the 5 days that you are at work, things that replenish you as an employee, whether it&#39;s a walk around the block, whether it&#39;s a trip to the gym, whether it&#39;s to the hairdresser&#39;s, and I know that&#39;s a very important thing for women in the workforce. Guys just rush along and get a hair cut in 20 minutes and back to work, it&#39;s really not an issue for them. So I&#39;d like to see those personal things in people&#39;s diary.</p>'

From school, people have used &quot;the old boy network&quot;, (you&#39;ve heard that before), which is a sort of an incestuous networking thing.</p>  <p>But these days networking&#39;s a much broader thing and it&#39;s much more respected by both individuals and organisations. So, I think you use your friends to talk about what do they think you&#39;re good at. So, use people you know to get an objective view about who you are and what you&#39;d be good at and then, you&#39;ve got something you can look for. So, who do they know? Does anyone know anyone in the IT industry? Who do know that works at Google? Your auntie, your brother, so ask all your relatives, send out emails to all of your friends. And the other way you can do it, which is something I really like, is if you&#39;re talking about an IT organisation, you start going along to functions that IT people go to, and you start looking for people who work in the organisation that you&#39;ve targeted, that you want to join in and you say very up-front: &quot;How do I get a job in your organisation? I&#39;ve loved it forever.&quot; &quot;Who are people that would hire a person with my skills and attributes in your organisation?&quot; &quot;How do I approach them? Where do they go to?&quot; So try and meet the people out of the work environment.</p>  <p>It&#39;s not devious, it&#39;s not being sneaky, it&#39;s just being clever. That&#39;s what networking&#39;s about: using that leverage, other people&#39;s knowledge and other people&#39;s contacts to help you get what you want, and it&#39;s not a bad thing. I don&#39;t mind when people ring me up and say &quot;This is what I&#39;m looking for. Do you know anyone who&#39;s can help?&quot; It&#39;s not a big deal to help people who are asking, it doesn&#39;t take long these days to click on a mouse and forward a CV, or forward a contact or ring someone up and say, you know, &quot;Paul Tyrrell, he&#39;s going to call you, can you please look after him?&quot;</p>'

	transcript = '<p>Well, networking inside an organisation to better your career is a critical thing, and I don&#39;t mean sucking up to the boss. I mean understanding how an organisation works.</p>  <p>And the first thing you&#39;ve got to do to be good network within your organisation is to be interested in that company. Be interested in the products that the company produces, understand where it fits in the business cycle. So understand and take an interest in where you work, that&#39;s the very first thing.</p>  <p>The second thing you need to do is you need to be really interested in people. I see a lot of people walk into their business every day and say &quot;Hi!&quot; to the person on the front desk, &quot;How&#39;re you going?&quot; and just keep walking.</p>  <p>They actually are not interested in that person, it&#39;s just a reflex action. They could stop for 15 seconds and say &quot;Hi Mary!&quot;, &quot;Hi Bill!&quot;, &quot;How was your weekend?&quot; or &quot;What did you get up to?&quot;, &quot;How&#39;re things going?&quot;, &quot;Everything going alright?&quot; and just that little moment where you take time to look into that person&#39;s eye and say &quot;I&#39;m interested in you as an individual&quot; is what networking is all about.</p>  <p>And networking, people get distracted sometimes, they think networking&#39;s about &quot;up&quot; networking. Networking is networking all over the organisation, to the &quot;little&quot; people and to the &quot;big&quot; people. Everybody&#39;s equally important. And so, being interested in the business, being interested in the people in the business, shows that you&#39;re passionate about your workplace.</p>  <p>And you can do extra things, you can think about people, you can bring in articles, you can know that someone likes mint in their tea. So one day you can bring mint out of your garden, or your parents&#39; garden, and bring that in and give it to them. Just those little extra things that nobody else does.</p>  <p>It&#39;s sure not sucking up to me, the boss, that makes me feel someone&#39;s a great networker. It&#39;s someone who is interested in everybody in the organisation and what we do.</p>  <p>Things you should never do in a job interview</p>  <p>Classics, which are a lot to do with nerves, but:</p>  <p>Forgetting the consultants name</p>  <p>Forgetting the name of the company they&#39;re applying for</p>  <p>Forgetting to bring their resume</p>  <p>Making things up about themselves</p>  <p>[Making things up] about how much experience they&#39;ve got</p>  <p>Forgetting the address, and being late</p>  <p>So, you think of any excuse you can think of, we&#39;ve heard them all.</p>  <p>When you&#39;re in an interview situation, an organisation, an employer or recruiter should understand - it&#39;s one of the most stressful things a person can do. Changing jobs is one of the most stressful things, next to buying a home, buying a car, having a child, getting married, getting divorced, having some sort of emotional trauma. Right up there with all of those things is an interview and trying to get a new role.</p>  <p>So, anyone doing the interviewing has to have some compassion and understanding. But you see just incredible things. I&#39;ve seen candidates so tired, falling asleep, forgetting the question.</p>  <p>Talking for too long. You get asked a question, they answer it, then they answer it again, then they answer it again and answer it again. They think, by talking, over and over and over, that will convince the interviewer that they&#39;re the right candidate.</p>  <p>You need to think.</p>  <p>I always say to people - The motto, particularly for all of us to remember, is that we have two ears, two eyes and one mouth and a nose and we need to use our senses, our sensory perception skills, in that order.</p>  <p>So, listen a lot, look a lot and speak only as needed. And I think that&#39;s the motto for a really good interview.</p>'
