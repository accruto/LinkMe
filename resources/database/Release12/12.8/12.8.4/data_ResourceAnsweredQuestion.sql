Not only are you competing against other foreign job seekers, but you’re competing against domestic job seekers who share similar skills and experiences. In good news however there are strategies you can begin to implement to help you in gaining that local experience</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Online Networking:</b> With no local experience you need to become an expert in networking and become an expert ASAP. Use online networking websites such as LinkedIn to make contacts with as many people as you can. Talk to people in your industry and find out comparisons (and differences) between the role you performed in your country of origin and the types of roles you are applying for in your new country. This way you can incorporate this into your resume and interview preparation. The more you understand about your new country, the greater chance you can prepare yourself for finding a new job.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Volunteer or Community Service:</b> Volunteering is a great way to get out and help people, meet people and it also looks great on the resume. Although it may not be paid work it still shows a potential employer that you have some level of experience working in your new country. </p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Think Outside the Square:</b> There are many ways to search for job openings - don’t get stuck with just applying for roles online.  My advice is to seek out hiring managers and people in positions to help you. Don’t be intimidated to approach these people directly. Although there may not be a current role open at their organisation, there is a possibility that they may know of other job openings or other areas within their business that is looking to hire. Finding the perfect job takes time and people appreciate pro-activeness.</p>'

Do not waste the reader’s time with irrelevant information that will not aid your job description. Statistically your resume has less than 30 seconds to shine so make sure the most important information is placed on the front page. If you require a certain qualification or licence make sure this is easily located on your resume.

Something that reads like: &quot;Self-motivated professional seeking a position with a company where I can develop my career and skills&quot;.

For example, if I am hiring a computer programmer and one of the requirements for the job is to be proficient in a range of computing languages such as C, Java, Perl etc. then I expect to see this on page 1 of the resume. By hiding this important information on page 3 is not beneficial for this job application. Employers can often receive hundreds of resumes for a particular job.

	text = '<p>The answer is no and here is why. Everything that belongs on the resume needs to be targeted towards the role you are applying for. In the limited space you have available on your resume you need to ensure that only the most relevant and important information is included. From a hiring manager’s perspective, they are going to evaluate your skills and experiences and then decided if you are worth interviewing. It is highly unlikely that a hiring manager will even bother to read your references and if they do it is even more unlikely that they will make a hiring decision based on who your references are.  What’s more is that at no stage during the initial selection process is a hiring manager going to contact your references. It just does not make sense. Why would someone contact your references before they have even met you? </p>  <p></p>  <p>All you need to do to show that you have references is include at the very end of your resume &quot;References Available Upon Request.&quot;  This states to the reader that if they decide to take your application further, you are able to provide them with references upon being requested. These 4 simple words should be the last 4 words you write on your resume. Generally speaking, only once you pass the initial resume screening process and have completed interviews would a hiring manager be interested in speaking with your contacts. Only at this stage would you be required to provide the name and contact details of your references.</p>'

	text = '<p>In order to succeed in the Australian job market your Australian resume needs to be written, structured, formatted and presented in the correct way. With competition for jobs in Australia at such a high demand, and in order to stand out from the competition, you need an Australian resume that adequately highlights your skills, achievements and value that you can bring to your next role. Below are my 3 most important tips for making your resume stand out.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Include a Qualifications Profile</b></p>  <p>Remember the number 1 rule about resume writing - highlight your achievements. Your resume is a marketing document and as such you need to emphasise to the reader your skills and expertise. Many times, job candidates will begin their resume with an objective statement where they describe to the reader the type of job that they are interested in. Unfortunately, a hiring manager is not interested in the types of positions you wish to apply for, but they are interested in knowing that you are passionate about the job position that they are advertising for. By replacing an objective statement with a qualifications profile will ensure that your resume begins with a powerful profile that highlights your value-added skills and qualifications.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Strategic Keywords</b></p>  <p>The use of Strategic keywords is essential for a modern day resume. When applying for a certain position, your resume may be one of a thousand that the company will receive. Rather than reading through every single resume, companies now use software programs as a way of performing the first round selection. By using strategic keywords you will not only make it through the first round of selection but you will give yourself every opportunity of standing out above your competition.</p>  <p></p>  <p><b>Demonstrate Flexibility, Adaptability and Innovation</b></p>  <p>Although you may not have local experience do not despair! In my experience employers want to hire job seekers who can demonstrate flexibility, adaptability and innovation as well as a passion for wanting to gain knowledge and experience. Think about extra-curricular activities, work experience, community service or volunteer work that you have performed and exhibited skills of flexibility, adaptability and innovation. Remember that an employer wants to know that you are going to bring value to the organisation. Use your resume to demonstrate that you are a forward-thinking self-starter with vision and desire to implement innovative solutions to any problem that may arise.</p>'

	text = '<p>Do you currently find yourself in a position of applying for multiple jobs every single day yet never seem to get a call back or interview request? Why does this happen? If you have the right skills and experience surely you should have hiring managers calling you to arrange an interview?</p>  <p> </p>  <p>Unfortunately job seeking is not as simple as just applying for jobs and waiting for the phone to ring. Demand for new jobs is more competitive than ever and with more and more people applying for jobs via online websites it is now much easier to send off your resume in a much shorter time period. I recently worked with a job seeker who had been laid off after 10 years of loyal service with the same company. This person told me that she was applying for up to 20 jobs a day. When I asked her if there were 20 new jobs being advertised every day that suited her skills she said she didn’t care. &quot;The more jobs I apply for the greater my chance of getting an interview.&quot;</p>  <p> </p>  <p>In my experience, if you are applying for jobs and never hearing back it is typically down to two main factors. Reason number one, is your resume is not good enough to attract the hiring manager and therefore your resume is most probably being deleted before the reader even has a chance to recognise the skills that you can bring to the role. The second reason you may be getting overlooked is simply that you are not qualified, skilled or experienced enough for the types of roles you are applying for. </p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Your resume is just not good enough:</b></p>  <p> </p>  <p>Before you apply for another job take a long hard look at your resume. If you were the hiring manager would you hire yourself based on your resume? Your resume is your marketing document and as such needs to be written to highlight your value added skills that you can bring to your next job. If you are applying for a management position you need to emphasise your management experience. Don’t assume that the hiring manager will know this information unless you provide evidence. For example, rather than just stating &quot;5 years of management experience&quot; which does not tell the reader much information apart from the obvious, you need to include further explanation to highlight this experience &quot;5 years of management experience leading expert teams, capable of analysing all areas of operations and implementing dynamic improvements, cost savings and overall growth and profit&quot; - From a hiring managers perspective it is obvious which statement stands out.</p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Are you qualified for the job you are applying for?</b></p>  <p> </p>  <p>Although you may think you could perform a certain job and maybe if given the chance you would prove to be the perfect person, unfortunately if the employer needs certain requirements they then expect that those applying for the role have these requirements.  If the job requires an accountant with minimum 2 years of experience with specific skills in auditing, it is not reasonable to think that they will hire a graduate accountant with less than 1 year of work experience. My advice is don’t waste your own time by applying for roles where you don’t meet certain expected requirements. </p>  <p> </p>  <p><b>Final thought:</b></p>  <p> </p>  <p>If you are not receiving interview requests and feel that you are being ignored every time you apply for a job, you’re not alone. Job seeking is a tough business, but in order to give yourself the greatest opportunity of finding success you need to ensure that your resume is written, structured and presented correctly. Every time you apply for a new job you may need to adjust or tweak your resume. Remember that the best resumes are those that are achievement based and written to target that specific job you are applying towards.</p>'
