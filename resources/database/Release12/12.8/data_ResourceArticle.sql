'Social Media: Your Online Footprint',
'<i>Paul Jury, Managing Director – Recruitment, Australia & New Zealand</i>
We’ve all done it…made a controversial ''wall'' comment, written a cheeky blog post or suffered as friends tag questionable photos of a big night out. It''s a bit of harmless fun - until your intentions turn professional and you begin approaching prospective employers and contacts for a new job. Have you ever considered they might be sneaking a peek at your online profile? Can your professional network find your personal details on Facebook? Is your LinkedIn profile true to your professional resume? And, how can your online activity impact your career potential?

<b>The Privacy Issue</b>
Online privacy is a controversial issue in Australia and not just for the sporting world or celebrities! It is well acknowledged that our legislation is having trouble keeping up with the pace of new technology. Right now, unless it is considered ''defamatory,'' there is little you can do to offset the publishing of your personal information; once it''s there, it''s there.

So, should prospective employers be privy to your personal or social information? The simple answer is no; your job application should be based on merit and all other factors discounted; however if you do publish personal information on the internet and it is easily accessible, hiring managers can and might learn more than you want them to know. This includes content posted on personal websites, blogs, social sites (e.g., Facebook, MySpace), Twitter, old resumes and out-of-date information on professional sites and comments in forums.  Also consider content on your friends'' forums as on some websites your information can be viewed via the activity of others, despite your privacy settings.

<b>What Should You Do?</b>
Online and social media tools can be critical to your job search, whether you are a member of niche job boards or blogs, are making the most out of career networking sites, or are receiving Twitter updates about the latest contract opportunities. However, it is important that you consider the personal/ professional divide carefully and are aware of the pitfalls of being social media savvy.

Not all publicity is good publicity and while you are actively job seeking, it is worth carefully considering the type of information that is out there and the potential impact of your online footprint.

<b>Google</b>
Do a quick online ''health check'' by conducting a Google search on yourself.  Whatever you find is pretty much what your prospective employer will see.  If there''s something potentially embarrassing or inappropriate (like that tagged photo), try to get rid of it.

If there is a media article that is contentious that you cannot remove, be prepared to cover it off in your interview as chances are your prospective employer has seen it.

<b>Facebook</b>
Review your privacy settings.  You can determine who sees your status, photos and posts and even your political and religious views.  During your job search, it''s probably a good idea to restrict all permissions to ''Friends'' only.

<b>LinkedIn</b>
If you don''t have a LinkedIn profile, get one, or if it''s incomplete, update it. Most employers and recruiters are now using LinkedIn to find potential job candidates. A LinkedIn profile will give you the opportunity to post a professional photo of yourself, write a respectable bio, and connect with other industry professionals. Remember to make sure your profile information is consistent with your current resume.

<b>Blogs</b>
A blog is an extremely effective way to demonstrate your expertise on your profession''s subject matter. By posting relevant content and educated opinions, this establishes your commitment to (and interest in) your industry, builds your credibility and also enhances your chances of being found by a headhunter. A professional blog also allows you to effectively build your own ''brand'', encourages dialogue with like-minded professionals, and gives you an ''industry expert'' reputation.

<b>TOP TIPS</b>
»	Do review and adjust your social media privacy settings whilst job hunting.
»	Do try to clean up anything that''s potentially embarrassing or inappropriate.
»	Do use professional networking sites such as LinkedIn to create a professional online profile.
»	Do consider posting anonymously or using a ''nickname'' if you contribute to a blog or site that you don''t want ''published'' professionally.
»	Do post a decent profile picture.
»	Don''t include a link on your resume to sites or blogs which include inappropriate/ personal content.
By performing some basic searches and cleaning up anything that might not be appropriate for your professional network, you can avoid being discounted for a job for which you are otherwise qualified.',

'Preparation is key to job searching',
'Job seeking can often be a lonely and frustrating business, but if you organise yourself properly, define what your preferences are and what goals you would like to achieve, then, it can make the job searching process more enjoyable.
 
Whether you''re looking for a job or a change of career, the approach should be similar and there are certain things that should be in place before you start on your path to finding suitable employment. Too often people jump straight into sending out their resume for every job under the sun. This approach is not just wrong but can be a total waste of time. Preparation is key to job seeking and those that prepare properly ultimately come out ahead. 
 
<b>Job Preparation and Research</b>
 Before you even begin to start thinking about applying for jobs, ensure that your professional resume is up to date and that your cover letter is targeted towards the jobs and industry you are applying for. Focus your resume on highlighting achievements and the value added skills that you can bring to the organisation. Remember that demand for jobs is ultra-competitive and when potential hiring managers may receive in excess of 500 resumes for one position, your resume needs to be perfect in order to stand out from the crowd.
 Once your resume and cover letter are ready to go, you need to decide exactly what type of work you want to do and where your skills are best suited. This will make the job search process more straightforward.

<b>Focus your job search</b>
 There are many different tactics you can implement to search for jobs. Don’t get stuck into only applying for online jobs because they are easy to apply for. Create profiles on different networking sites such as LinkedIn. A LinkedIn profile is a fantastic way to attract recruiters and potential head hunters. You can also use networking sites to find job vacancies, network with hiring managers and meet other job seekers who are in the same shoes as you.
 
<b>Remain Positive and Focused</b>
 Job seeking is not easy and can often take a long period of time. Rather than sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring, utilise this time to learn a new skill. (Have you ever wanted to learn a new language?) Perform community service or even just try to improve your health. The more you focus on the negative the more depressed and stressed you will become. Set out a certain amount of time every day to job search and spend the other time in the day doing something else.
 
Having a common sense approach to your job searching will make it easier in finding suitable employment. 
Adopting a flexible approach, a willingness for work and a good attitude will give you more leverage and help in your quest of finding the ideal job. ',

'What are the hardest challenges facing college graduates',
'<b>Competition (too few jobs and too many graduates)</b>
Here is the scenario… You have graduated college with a good looking degree; you feel on top of the world and ready to pick and choose your dream job. The reality however is that your one of a many in the same boat. While you feel as though you would be best suited for a particular role there can be hundreds of other people who feel the same way as you. I often tell the story about my days as a recruitment consultant where I used to recruit for graduate positions. I would post a graduate position on the job boards and by lunch time I would have 200 applicants in my inbox. So what can you do to differentiate yourself from the rest of the crowd? You need to ensure that your resume is in the top 5-10% of all resumes. A single mistake in your resume can be the difference between your resume ending up in the interview stack or in the deleted folder
<b>Downturn in the economy</b>
We are all sick and tired of hearing about the global financial situation, sluggish economic growth and rising unemployment. Unfortunately this is the situation which new graduates find themselves facing when looking for a job. My best advice is to network, stay patient and increase the effort into the job search. You are going to have setbacks and days when you feel like the whole world is against you. The real challenge will be ones of Continuing perseverance and confidence.
<b>Lack of Real world experience</b>
My advice to all graduates (and those preparing to graduate) is to seek work experience. I personally hated this advice while I was at university but looking back now my work experience helped me plan out my career and gain vital experience in competitive industries. When the time came to put forward my resume, my previous work experience set me apart from many of my competitors.
<b>Too high expectations</b>
Many graduates (myself included) complete university and expect to hand pick the job which they want. Furthermore, graduates have an expectation that they know what is best and should actually be the boss rather than working for the boss. So many times I have had graduates apply for job positions which are so unrealistic and then get despondent because they are not getting interview requests. It’s important for graduates to realize that they need to gain the experience before they can call themselves the boss.
<b>Debate between further higher education and job seeking</b>
Do you continue to study or start straight away with the job seeking? Many graduates don’t have a choice in this matter but for those who do continuing to study can lead to greater results long term (financial and job position) and also further help distinguish yourself apart from other graduates. On the other hand is it better to start working and get your foot in the door? There’s no better education then real life experience of learning on the job.',
