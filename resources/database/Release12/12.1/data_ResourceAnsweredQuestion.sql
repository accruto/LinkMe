'Can you use the same resume for every job application?',
'Every job you apply for will be different and as such you need to adapt your resume accordingly. Writing the perfect resume will be different depending on the job and each resume needs to be tailored and specific towards that position. 

No matter what position you are applying for the more targeted your resume the greater your chances of finding success. With competition for jobs so intense in order to stand out from the crowd you need to ensure that your skills tick all the boxes that the hiring manger is looking for in the perfect candidate.

Don’t be alarmed at the prospect of having to design a new resume for every job application. There are certain parts of the resume that will always stay the same however there are certain parts that need to be adapted. A powerful, eye-catching qualifications summary at the top of your resume is the best way to attract a hiring manager’s eye and let them immediately of your skills and experience. The other main area of your resume to change is keywords. Many times recruiters or hiring managers will often skim over the resume looking for keywords or use software programs to find key words.  These key words can be changed depending on the job you are applying for. 

Remember one thing – the aim of the resume is to attract the reader’s attention. By targeting your resume you will give yourself the greatest opportunity of finding success.',

'How important is it to include achievements in the resume?',
'Achievement based resume writing is key and the difference between a good resume and a great resume comes down to including achievements.

Failing to include key achievements throughout your resume is a recipe for disaster and will cause your resume to be put straight in the deleted folder and never to be seen again.

The job market is competitive, and if you’re going to prove to the hiring manager that you are the best candidate for a job, you need to show off every key achievement and skill that will stand you out against all the other job candidates.  Remember the golden rule of resume writing – your resume is a marketing document and, as such, needs to market all the great things that you can bring to a potential job. Providing achievements that are backed up with quantitative evidence will guarantee that you will stand out from the other job seekers.

The best written resumes adequately sell the person’s achievements, skills and personality. Do this correctly and I guarantee that you will find success.',

'What should I include in my Australian Resume?',
'A well written and properly presented Australian resume can be your ticket to finding an Australian job. The Australian job market is different to job markets around the world and it is important that your resume is presented in the “Australian way”

Responsibilities, achievements and duties need to be written clearly and backed up with supporting evidence. If these are not present, it is assumed you do not have any experience at all

Use British English ONLY in your Australian Resume – words such as “specialise” and “realise” need to be spelled with an “s” not a “z”

Ensure you tailor EVERY application to suit the job for which you are applying. If you are going to stand out from the crowd, you have to make sure that your application is outstanding

No picture is necessary on your Australian Resume

Do not include personal information such as marital status, date of birth, number of children, occupation of spouse, gender, religious affiliation, colour or race on your resume. It is true that in certain countries (South Africa, for example) personal information is included and is required, however it is not necessary or needed on your Australian Resume

Spend as much time as possible ensuring you address EXACTLY what the Australian employer wants. For example, if the job advertisement lists certain duties for the job, make sure you incorporate these duties into your current resume. If the job requires excellent customer service skills, provide examples about how you have provided excellent customer service

Get the edge on other job seekers and save yourself enormous amounts of time and stress by ensuring your resume ticks all the right boxes.',

'How do I find work without any local experience?',
'As a foreign job seeker trying to find work in your new country, the odds are stacked up against you. Not only are you competing against other foreign job seekers, but you’re competing against domestic job seekers who share similar skills and experiences. In good news however there are strategies you can begin to implement to help you in gaining that local experience

<b>Online Networking:</b> With no local experience you need to become an expert in networking and become an expert ASAP. Use online networking websites such as LinkedIn to make contacts with as many people as you can. Talk to people in your industry and find out comparisons (and differences) between the role you performed in your country of origin and the types of roles you are applying for in your new country. This way you can incorporate this into your resume and interview preparation. The more you understand about your new country, the greater chance you can prepare yourself for finding a new job.

<b>Volunteer or Community Service:</b> Volunteering is a great way to get out and help people, meet people and it also looks great on the resume. Although it may not be paid work it still shows a potential employer that you have some level of experience working in your new country. 

<b>Think Outside the Square:</b> There are many ways to search for job openings – don’t get stuck with just applying for roles online.  My advice is to seek out hiring managers and people in positions to help you. Don’t be intimidated to approach these people directly. Although there may not be a current role open at their organisation, there is a possibility that they may know of other job openings or other areas within their business that is looking to hire. Finding the perfect job takes time and people appreciate pro-activeness.',

'Do References belong on the Resume?',
'The answer is no and here is why. Everything that belongs on the resume needs to be targeted towards the role you are applying for. In the limited space you have available on your resume you need to ensure that only the most relevant and important information is included. From a hiring manager’s perspective, they are going to evaluate your skills and experiences and then decided if you are worth interviewing. It is highly unlikely that a hiring manager will even bother to read your references and if they do it is even more unlikely that they will make a hiring decision based on who your references are.  What’s more is that at no stage during the initial selection process is a hiring manager going to contact your references. It just does not make sense. Why would someone contact your references before they have even met you? 

All you need to do to show that you have references is include at the very end of your resume “References Available Upon Request.”  This states to the reader that if they decide to take your application further, you are able to provide them with references upon being requested. These 4 simple words should be the last 4 words you write on your resume. Generally speaking, only once you pass the initial resume screening process and have completed interviews would a hiring manager be interested in speaking with your contacts. Only at this stage would you be required to provide the name and contact details of your references.',

'What are some tips to writing a good cover letter?',
'Most people hate writing a cover letter even more than they hate preparing a resume. In the competitive job environment where first impressions count and the time we have to impress the potential reader is becoming shorter and shorter, the most effective way to ensure that your application stands out from the competition is through a professionally written cover letter. There is, however, a fine line between a cover letter that enhances your application and a cover letter that can actually do you a disservice. 

My 3 top tips:

1)	Establish your reason for applying to the role within the first couple of sentences and make it clear to the reader that you have unique attributes that make you the perfect person for the job.
2)	Target you cover letter to the reader and make sure that they know that your letter has been written for their specific job
3)	Forget the Clichés!',
