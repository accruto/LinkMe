	'I uploaded my resume and it now looks a mess  - what can I do?',
	'<p>From time to time, our resume upload program can make mistakes, as you have noticed. We are busy trying to improve it, but it is a difficult job because everyone''s resume is formatted differently. </p><p></p><p>There are several reasons for us asking members to upload their resume and then have the system try and interpret it, rather than just copy it word for word with all the formatting:</p><p></p><p>1. Employers and recruiters often want to search across all the resumes looking for particular details;</p><p></p><p>2. We can put all the resumes into a standard format, which makes it easier for members to simply "fill in the blanks";</p><p></p><p>3. We are able to omit certain details if the member chooses to protect the identity. For example, we can hide the member''s name, contact details or current and previous employers, in case the candidate wishes to remain anonymous, but still be "in the market for a new job". </p><p>We do understand your concerns about the presentation of your resume, and we are currently working on a number of features including:</p><p></p><p>•Providing a choice of resume styles (the chronological style does not suit everyone);</p><p></p><p>•Improving the performance of the automated resume upload feature;</p><p></p><p>•Improving the ease of editing resumes online;</p><p></p><p>•Providing members the option of having various resumes in their profile eg. one which is tailored for engineering employers/recruiters, and another which is tailored for mining employers/recruiters;</p><p></p><p>•improving the presentation of resumes when viewed on screen or printed. </p><p>In practice, we have found that our employers and recruiters use LinkMe to find candidates by specifying criteria.  You can pretend to be your ideal employer and try to find your LinkMe profile here.  When employers find candidates they often contact the candidate directly and may ask them to send their up-to-date resume, complete with their own formatting and presentation. </p><p></p><p>Also, when members apply for jobs, the LinkMe site allows members to select which resume format they’d like sent to employers: either their original DOC/PDF/RTF/TXT resume, the LinkMe formatted resume, or another resume file of their choice. </p><p></p><p>We are also working on an article about how members can improve their chances of being found by potential employers/recruiters. In the meantime, please have a look at the various articles in the LinkMe resources section. </p>',
