	'What does it cost to post a job ad? What are your purchase options?',
	'<p>LinkMe offers two pricing models for job ads: pay-per-ad and pay-per-applicant. </p>
<p></p>
<p>With pay-per-ad, you pay a fixed price for every ad posted to the LinkMe job board. This means you know in advance what your job ad expenditure is going to be – great for budgeting. You pay a lower cost per ad the more ads you commit to purchasing. You can purchase small volumes of ads online using a credit card, or for larger volume discounts, contact our sales team on 1800 546 563. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The pay-per-applicant approach is about risk-sharing and means LinkMe shares in your success or failure: if your ad performs well (i.e. you receive many responses) then your total cost is higher; if your ad only receives a few applicants, then the cost for that ad is lower or even zero. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To use pay-per-applicant pricing, you will first need to pre-purchase a set number of applicants by contacting our sales team. You can then post as many ads as you like and applicant credits will be deducted as candidates apply to your ads. We cap the total applicants for any ad at 20 applicants, so for example if your ad receives more than 20 applicants, you receive the surplus for free. You receive larger discounts for by pre-purchasing larger amounts of applicants – contact our sales team on 1800 546 563 for more details. </p>',

<p>2.	Tell us how great your company is! - Remember, your audience may know little to nothing about your organisation. Hook your applicants in by describing the benefits of your team culture, location, team activities and organisational goals to make you stand out from the pack. </p>
<p>3.	List key skills to avoid confusion - Make it easy for applicants to access themselves and their suitability for your role by clearly listing the main responsibilities, as well as your expectations as to the skill set and experience needed to fulfill the role. </p>
<p>4.	Specify a salary - By specifying a salary, you will limit the amount of unsuitable applicants, as again candidates can "self screen" based on their own salary expectations. </p>',

<p></p>
<p>Each candidate in the LinkMe database is required to nominate a <b>Job Hunter Status</b>. These are visible from your free search, and you can make an assessment as to whether to contact the candidate based on their status. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The statuses we use are:</p>
<p></p>
<p>•	Immediately Available: This means that the candidate has said they are ready for a same or next day start</p>
<p>•	Actively Looking: This means that the candidate is looking for a new opportunity, but may need to provide notice to their current employer</p>
<p>•	Not Looking but happy to talk: This means that the candidate is not actively looking for a new role, however may be tempted by potential opportunities</p>
<p></p>
<p>Any candidate who has nominated themselves as active or immediately available must confirm their availability periodically, so you know that someone who says they’re “immediately available” has confirmed their interest within the past week. LinkMe automatically downgrades candidate statuses if candidates do not confirm their availability status within the allocated time. </p>',
