	'What other kinds of scams are there?',
	'<p>There are many ways that scammers will attempt to steal your details or money, for various reasons. Below are 3 of the most common examples, though for an up to date list on current scams, visit www.scamwatch.gov.au </p><p>  </p><p>1. Work from home! Earn over $2,000 a day! – The ‘pay for a guaranteed job’ scam</p><p>  </p><p>Any email that sounds too good to be true, probably is. Job ads or emails that advertise a large income in exchange for very little work are highly likely to be fraudulent. Any such ad, email or application process that asks you for payment, to transfer funds or to recruit other people should be treated with suspicion. </p><p></p><p>2. Congratulations – you’ve got the job! – Another ‘pay for a guaranteed job’ scam</p><p>  </p><p>Some scams may guarantee you a job or income in return for an up front fee to purchase materials, business plans or training manuals. If you have not met the employer and been through an interview and selection process, a job offer of this kind is unlikely to be genuine.  </p><p>  </p><p>3. “Please help” – the large inheritance scam</p><p>  </p><p>Some emails appear to be sent by people desperately in need of help, for example they may detail a personal tragedy or circumstance to gain your sympathy. These scammers then use your sympathy to try to entice you to help them by providing your bank details to assist in transferring a large amount of money (inheritance typically), for a reward. This is a scam designed only to obtain your bank details and to launder money.</p>',
