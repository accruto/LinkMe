<b>Information Use</b><P>

The LINKME service is provided to assist users to network with other users in order to make contacts to assist them in their professional development. The service is also designed to reduce the time and effort it takes to find new employment opportunities by allowing those users, who nominate that they wish to participate, to have their details, skills and experience searchable by applicable employers and recruiters. Your contact information is only given to these specific third parties if you nominate it to be so.<P>

LINKME will communicate with users via email. LINKME users will also communicate with other users via email. LINKME from time to time will ask users to update their profile / CV information by submitting updated information or CV's. LINKME will also send news to users about new features and updates to the LINKME service.<P>

<b>Information Sharing</b><P>

<ul>
<i>Third Party Searching</i><br>
LINKME values users and therefore will only share information with third parties as nominated by the user, specifically for the purpose of employment opportunities.<p> 
Networker to Networker interaction is anonymous until users choose to reveal their details to each other. Only anonymous excerpts of user information are shown to networkers for the purpose of validating searches on specific user attributes.<p> 
<b>Note:</b> Users will always know the identity of those users whom they invited in the first instance - They had to know them to invite them.<p>
<i>Partnering</i><br>
LINKME may partner with other service providers in order to evolve or expand the LINKME service offering and these services will only be marketed to users via the web site or email if nominated by the user.
<p>
<i>Communications between Users</i><br>
Many emails you initiate through LINKME, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your name in the subject line of the message. Emails you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will never list the people to whom you are directly connected.
<p> 
Other communications that you initiate through the LINKME website, like a request for contact, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if you choose to disclose that information.<p>
<i>Legal Disclaimer</i><br>
LINKME may also have to 
              share information with law enforcement agencies should it be 
              compelled to do so.</p>
