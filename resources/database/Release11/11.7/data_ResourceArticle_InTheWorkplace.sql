'Best Tips on How to Get That Pay Raise You Deserve',
'<b>Waiting on that raise that never seems to come…</b>
A friend recently told me that he was expecting a raise soon simply because “I haven’t gotten one in the last 2 years.” There was no direct reason – no one had told him about this supposed upcoming raise, and he hadn’t done anything major in the last few months to expect one. He simply expected that one would come, particularly because he hadn’t received one in his entire 2 years there.
I always wonder about this kind of thinking because, from the way I see it, employers are never lining up to give people more money. If you’re waiting around for your boss to give you a raise for no specific reason, you’re going to be waiting for a long time. A raise doesn’t come simply because you’ve worked somewhere for a specific amount of time or because you haven’t received one – you have to earn a raise and, even when you do, you probably still have to ask for it.
It’s no secret that an employer is going to try to pay you as little as possible. I don’t mean this in a mean way – I’m just saying that they aren’t going to go out of their way to pay you more than they have to, simple as that. This especially applies to those of you waiting on that raise you haven’t received yet. Think about it – why would your boss give you more money to do the same exact job? What would be in it for them? Whether you’re deserving of a raise or not, it’s not going to come at the drop of a hat.
Employers are not looking to give away money that they don’t have to, so if you continue to wait for them to offer you one, you may be waiting a while. If you think you deserve a raise, let your boss know and give your specific reasons. This can include examples where you have increased productivity, saved them money or even how you trained new employees.
Providing specific reasons is the key to getting your pay increase. Remember everyone wants more pay and greater benefits. A pay rise is just like a negotiation. You have to provide something in return to receiving something. If you can prove to your employer that you are worthy of a pay increase your employee is more likely to give you one.
 One last thing. If you feel you deserve a pay rise and have evidence to support your argument, don’t be afraid to ask for it. A lot of people sit quietly and say nothing to avoid “rocking the boat,” and they have the mindset that a pay rise will eventually happen on its own. Don’t let this happen to you. You deserve to get paid as much as you can.',

'Building a Strong Relationship With Your Boss',
'No one likes a “suck up” or a “teacher’s pet”, but let’s be honest – staying in the manager''s good books at work is important not only to keep your job, but for your long term growth. It is highly unlikely that your boss will push to promote you or give you a pay increase if he or she does not like you. It does not seem fair, but this is just the way it is.
<b>Learn from your boss</b>
Generally speaking, your boss is probably more experienced than you, which is why they''re in a position of management. Take time to learn from your boss by asking questions. Don’t be afraid to approach them. In most situations, he or she will be happy that you are seeking them out for advice, and in return will be more willing to take the time to help you out.

<b>Be honest with your boss</b>
If you make a mistake with your work or you''ve done something wrong, don''t try to lie or cover it up. In the long term this can only come back to hurt you. Approach your boss and be honest. Explain the mistake you''ve made and let them know how you''re going to fix it. Nobody is perfect and no one expects you to be perfect. Honesty is the best policy. Your boss will also respect you more for being honest from the beginning rather than trying to hide your mistakes.

<b>Don’t have an Ego</b>
Nobody likes an egomaniac. Lead by example through your actions rather than your words. No matter what job you do or what industry you''re in, the best workers always lead by example.

<b>Don’t take credit for other peoples work</b>
Taking credit for other peoples'' work is a big no no. Not only is it dishonest, but sooner than later your boss will find out. In the meantime, your co-workers will begin to lose respect for you, which can severely hamper your chances of one day being in a situation where you become their boss. Being a good team player means acknowledging co-workers when they do good work and encouraging everyone to put their best foot forward.

<b>Build a positive relationship with your boss not a false relationship</b>
Just like you, your boss is only human. Yes they may have more responsibilities, but they still experience and share all the same human feelings as you will feel on a day to day basis. You do not have to be best friends with your boss, but you need to respect them and value their time. Do not try to constantly flatter them. Your boss is no fool and will quickly realise what you are doing. This can severely hurt your relationship as you will lose credibility, and in certain circumstances this can lead to them either disliking you or not taking you seriously.
In conclusion, a positive relationship with your boss and co-workers will make for a happy and healthy career. We spend so much of our lives at work that it is important not just to stay on our managers good side for promotion reasons, but also to ensure that we achieve maximum satisfaction from our jobs.',

'How to Succeed When Working From Home',
'As a resume writer there are often days where I can work from home in the luxury of my lounge room without having to step foot outside my house.  I save money and time on transport and what is best is that I can work all day in whatever clothes I desire. If I want to sit in my brand new matching pyjama pants and shirt, well I can because these are just some of the advantages of working from home.
This sounds wonderful doesn’t it? Sitting all day in your pyjamas working on your own schedule? This sounds great in theory, but in reality I strongly suggest against this type of approach.

<b>Always Dress for Success</b>
When I am dressed for success and feeling professional, I find that I am more productive and produce far greater work. Sitting at my desk in my corporate attire puts me in a work mood as opposed to making my day feel like a casual day. I obviously don’t suggest putting on your best suit and tie when working from home, but a nice clean and pressed shirt and trousers will certainly put you in the work mode.

<b>Find an area of your house to make into “an office”</b>
Although you’re at home, try to find a small space that you can work from. Setting up a small area of your house or apartment to make a working space will put you in the working mood. Have you ever tried working from bed? This is almost impossible, and the amount of work you can do while in bed is not nearly as productive as the work you can do from your desk.

<b>Is working at home for you?</b>
Working at home is not for everyone, and many people find that they get too distracted and are not able to be productive. Having good discipline is a major factor in being able to work from home. There are many temptations surrounding you and maintaining motivation can be a challenge. And although it’s nice to have a day outside the traditional office, working from home can be lonely, and with limited social interaction it can often be hard to share ideas.

<b>Conclusion</b>
Working from home can be extremely productive and beneficial. Without having the sound of telephones ringing and co-workers talking around you, there is opportunity to get a lot of work completed that you would not have been able to do in the office environment.
My advice is simple. When working from home, dress professionally and set up a workspace where you can best get in the grove to perform your work as best as possible. I personally feel more switched on when I am in my work clothes rather than my casual clothes. Looking like a professional makes me feel like a professional.',

'Tips on Keeping Your New Job',
'Congratulations on securing your job. You have been selected above and beyond the other job applicants because of all the wonderful factors that made you the best fit for the job. Now that you have the job there are many tips to keeping your position and maintaining a professional image. 
Understand your role and expectations. 
You may feel as though you are doing a fantastic job, but if your expectations differ from those of your manager or boss, there is going to be conflict. Have a good understanding of what is expected of you. If you feel that the expectations are unrealistic, then you need to approach your boss and explain the situation. One of the most important aspects of maintaining a professional image is being a good team player and contributing fairly to the team objectives. No one likes a colleague who does not do their fair share of the work.

<b>Expand your role and keep on learning</b>
Be a team player and look to get involved in more areas of the business. Be willing to share your expertise, but also be willing to learn new skills. If your company offers training courses, put your hand up to get involved. If your company doesn’t offer training courses, you can still take the initiative and invest in your own growth and knowledge by paying for these courses yourself. 

<b>Develop Positive Relationships</b>
We all spend so much time at work that it is important to develop positive relationships with all of our co-workers, managers and bosses. Good relationships are based on trust. Keep commitments. If you promise something, make sure you deliver on time. However, if you find yourself in a situation where something has changed and you cannot keep that commitment, be honest and communicate.  Honest communication is the key to building a long-lasting relationship. 

<b>Be Visible</b>
Leaving early every day and not attending social gatherings is definitely not the right way to maintain a professional image. Being visible is all part of being a good team player. This does not mean you have to be best friends with every person you work with, but there is no need to isolate yourself either.

<b>Ask for feedback and learn from your boss</b>
Do not be afraid to ask for feedback. In order to grow and improve ourselves, we need feedback on how we are performing in our jobs. Positive feedback is always fantastic, however don’t be put down by negative feedback and certainly do not hold grudges. Learn from your mistakes and strive to do better going forward.  
We spend so many hours at work that we need to enjoy what we are doing. Maintaining a professional image will help you not only build a reputation of someone who is a great team player and can be counted on to add value to the business, but will also make your work life a far greater experience. When the time comes for a promotion or a pay rise, you are far more likely to be considered because of your professional attitude and image.',
