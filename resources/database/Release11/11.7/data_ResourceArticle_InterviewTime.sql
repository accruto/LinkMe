'How to Ace Behavioural Job Interview Questions',
'1) Take a blank piece of paper and write down between 10-20 examples from your education, work experience, community work, charity etc of where you added value in a positive way.
2) Now using the STAR format write out the Situation, Task, Action, Result

<b>Example 1</b>
“Give me an example of a time when you set a goal and were able to meet or achieve it.”
<b>S</b>ituation
My role as project manager was to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget.
<b>T</b>ask
My last role involved combining three office spaces into one. With a tight deadline of 90 and dealing with multiple contractors from different companies I knew it was going to be a struggle to complete the job in time. I set the goal of having everything completed within 80 days to give us 10 days at the end to make final corrections.
<b>A</b>ction
By dividing all the different contractors into three main teams and having three project managers controlling the three teams I was able to create a more efficient and effective work timetable and ensure that downtime was kept to a minimum.
<b>R</b>esult
As a result of this more efficient working time we completed the job on time and reduced costs by 15%. This new way of dividing contractors into smaller teams has now been implemented into standard work procedure and seen a reduction in overall costs.

<b>Example 2</b>
(Question is asked to a student or graduate)
"Tell me about a time during school when you displayed good leadership skills."
(<b>S</b>ituation) "As a senior member of the debating team, (<b>T</b>ask) I noticed that the team performance and moral was being deteriorated due to fighting between two members of the team. (<b>A</b>ction) I decided to speak one on one with each individual away from the groups in order to create an environment where they could trust me and open up to me with the issues. (<b>R</b>esult) After speaking with both individuals I was able to convince them to meet face to face and sort out the issues with me as the mediator as opposed to getting teachers involved. As a result the two individuals were able to sort out their differences, shake hands and our team was able to function again as a complete team working together.

As you can see from both examples, the key to interviewing success is simply preparing for the questions and having a mental outline to follow when responding to each question. Preparing stories or examples that illustrate how you solved the problem or how you performed in an outstanding way will help you respond to any behavioural question that comes your way.',

'How to Ace the Telephone Interview',
'Phone interviews are becoming increasingly popular as a means of narrowing down candidates for a more traditional face to face interview. In the ultra competitive society we now live, a job advertisement can attract hundreds of resumes from candidates with similar set of skills and backgrounds. The recruitment process is all about finding the one perfect candidate among the basket full of candidates.  The phone interview has become a popular, flexible, inexpensive and speedy way of finding that one person. 

<b>Preparing for a phone interview</b>
 Before you begin your phone interview make sure that you are confident in your understanding of the position you are applying for and the company you are applying with. Do extra homework on the company’s history and research recent company news. Preparation is the key and will make a great impression on your interviewers.
Prepare your Interview location. Make sure you’re in a comfortable place with no distractions. Keep your resume in clear view, have a pen and pad to take notes and a glass of water sitting close by. Minimise any outside distractions that could potentially take your mind off the interview (HOT TIP: Disable call waiting on your phone). Dress the part so you feel and sound professional. The more professional you feel the more professional you will come across on the telephone.
Most importantly – Practice Interviewing. Rehearse and Practice.  There are many ways to help you prepare for the telephone interview.  Have a friend/ family member conduct an interview.  Ideally, rehearse with someone from the same industry. The best way to hear how you sound is to tape yourself. Remember the more preparation you put into the interview the better prepared you will be.
Preparation is the key! Write down answers to questions you believe are going to be asked. Have questions ready to go so when the interviewer says “Do you have any questions to ask us” you’re ready and prepared.

<b>What to do during the phone interview</b>
Remember to Smile. Experts say that smiling puts you in a better state of mind and will project a positive image to the listener
Speak in a steady voice.  Don’t rush what you’re trying to say. Ensure that you sound enthusiastic and passionate.
Don’t forget to breathe. It will help you stay calm and sound more relaxed.
LISTEN – Answer the questions which are being asked. Do not make the mistake of telling the interviewer what you want to tell them. Give them the answers to their questions.
Keep a glass of water handy – Nothing is worse than having a dry mouth
Address the interviewer in the appropriate way. Do not shorten people’s name. They are your potential employer not your “mate”
Take your time – Don’t rush the interview. This is your time to shine.  If your feeling nervous take a moment or two to collect your thoughts
“Cheat Notes” Prepare beforehand with notes to help drive you through the interview. If the interview is going to be technical than have notes ready to prompt yourself if needed
Don’t forget to ask questions. (For tips on the best interview questions to ask go to the “Tips from the Pros” page of www.redstarresume.com)

<b>What NOT to do during the interview</b>
•	Don’t eat, drink, chew gum
•	DO NOT SMOKE
•	Don’t interrupt the interviewer.
•	Don’t answer with just a “yes” and “no”- elaborate your answers, provide examples if applicable
•	Don’t be too Casual/informal
•	Long winded answers to questions

<b>Conclusion</b>
The only way to master a phone interview is to practice, be professional, and show your passion for the job role. Remember you have made the phone interview stage so don’t blow your interview by not being ready.',

'Traditional Job Interview Questions Part 1',
'What are general interview questions?
Best to prepare answers to these types of questions, but do not try to memorize exact answers word for word. It will sound scripted and will be easily picked up. What you need to do is have your answers planned, but be ready to adapt or change your answers depending on how well the interview is going.
There are literally thousands of “general interview questions”. We have selected the most frequently asked questions and have given you examples of how best to answer these questions.

<b>Tell Me About Yourself?</b>
This is the most common question to begin the interview. It is so important that you are prepared for this question so you can give a good solid first impression before the interviewer moves onto the more challenging questions. Be careful to not to give the interviewer your life story or provide “too much information”. I have had candidates who have told me how they have a criminal past or how they despised their family, and this is not something you need to voluntarily bring up in an interview. Relevant facts about education and your career is all you need to be speaking about.
Tip: Remember to tailor your answers toward the job you are applying for. If you’re applying for a role as a fashion editor for a magazine, tell the interviewer how from an early age you have always had a love for fashion and writing, and provide examples about how your passion has bought you to that interview.

<b>Why Did You Decide To Leave Your Last Job?</b>
Be careful!!! Do NOT (and I can’t stress this enough) bad mouth your old employer. Present yourself in a positive way. It is extremely unprofessional to talk badly about your previous company, boss or peers, no matter what the reason. You also don’t know if this new hiring manager knows people from your old company. The best way to answer this question is to tell them that you are looking for career advancement and you see this new company being the right career choice for you. 
How to answer this question if you were fired:
TIP: If you were fired from your last job do not try to lie about it or cover it up in the interview. More than likely the company will do a background check on you anyway, so it is best to be upfront and honest. Trust me, you are not the first person to be fired. The best way to answer the question is to keep it brief and ensure the interview keeps flowing forward. Turn the negative into a positive by letting the interviewer know how you learnt from the experience and are now ready to move on.
Example: “The job was going in a different direction to where I wanted to be going. My boss and I both thought it was best to move on to a job where I could be of greater value and offer my skills in the most maximising way.”

<b>Where Else Have You Been Interviewing?</b>
Don’t be afraid to answer this question. The key to answering this correctly is to prove to the hiring manager that you are serious about finding a new job. This being said, you only want to mention a couple of places you’ve applied to rather than going into major details. If you’ve applied to many jobs, don’t admit this as you don’t want to come across as desperate. The aim of this question is to see if you really are seriously looking for a new job. There is nothing wrong with showing the employer that you are serious to find a new role.

<b>What’s Your Greatest Strength?</b>
This is one of the easier interview questions, but to get the most out of your answer the best response needs to be related to the job you are applying for. IF you’re an accountant and applying for an accountancy role, the best response you can give for your greatest strength is your ability with numbers, your computer skills and your attention to detail. How about if you’re a dancer applying for a role? Your greatest strengths need to be balance, team work, dedication etc.
Rather than using generic clichéd answers such as “hard-working” and “loyal”, use this question to show the value you can add to the organisation.

<b>What’s Your Biggest Weakness?</b>
Without doubt one of the hardest questions to answer. Being too honest can severely affect your interview. Everyone has something they can work on, so saying you have no weaknesses makes you sound arrogant. The best way to approach this is to think of a weakness that won’t impact your getting the job. Remember that this question is a work-related question, so don’t say that your biggest weakness is not helping enough around the house or, the worst answer I ever heard, “chocolate cake.”
Tips:
1)    Do not mention a weakness that will prevent you from being hired. If you’re going for a job as a telemarketer, don’t say your greatest weakness is speaking on the telephone!
2)    No clichéd responses. “My greatest weakness is that I am a perfectionist.”
3)    Do not avoid the question. The interviewer has asked you this question and you need to answer it.
My advice is to provide a real work-related weakness and follow it up with examples of how you are fixing the problem.
Example:
If you’re asked this question, give a small, work-related flaw that you’re working hard to improve. Example: “I’ve been told that I occasionally focus on details and miss the bigger picture, so I’ve been spending time laying out the complete project every day to see my overall progress.”
Admitting a real weakness and then following up with what you’re doing to improve yourself is preferable. “My presentation skills are not as strong as I’d like, so I signed up for weekend presentation skills classes and also joined a Toastmasters club.” Remember that the specific job you are interviewing for will help to determine how you answer the question.

<b>Why Have You Applied For This Job?</b>
This is a fairly innocent question and easy enough to answer. To answer this question successfully you need to show your motivation for this role, but also your desire to work for the company. Through your research into the company provide further examples why this job is the job for you.
Tip: Never say “money”!

<b>Where Do You See Yourself In Five Tears Time?</b>
This type of question is seeing the extent of your ambition. Be careful when answering this question not to make it seem as though this job is a stepping stone in your career (even if it is). For example, if you are applying for an accounting job at an accounting firm, don’t tell the interviewer that your long term goal is to work at an investment bank. This is not what the interviewer is going to want to hear. The last thing an employer wants to do is employ you, train you and then see you leave the firm. The best answer you can offer is to demonstrate that your 5 year goals are suitable and match the position you are applying for.',

'Traditional Job Interview Questions Part 2',
'<b>Why Should We Hire You For This Job?</b>
The reason they should hire you is because you’re best person for the job because of your skills and competence and also because of the enthusiasm you will bring to the role. You can be assured that 90% of the candidates will start pitching their skills and achievements, but what makes you stand out more is your enthusiasm and passion for the role. When describing your skills and achievements, relate them to the job description and give reasons why you would add value to the business. When pitching yourself, remember the importance of body language. Sit up in your chair and be positive.
Tip: Prepare for the interview by taking the job description and write down the skills you bring to each description and examples of accomplishments and achievements. Having examples ready to go can really help you when answering this question.
Example answer: (applying for a sales position)
“With my 5 years of work experience I have developed, maintained and expanded customer relationships, positioned new products to drive sales growth and developed new marketing strategies to ensure sales targets are exceeded and market share increased. I have expertise in the implementation of account strategies, tactical sales and marketing plans. As you can see my sales records speak for themselves, and in my previous role I was awarded for consistently exceeding sales and profit targets. Most importantly, I am extremely passionate about what I do and have a love for sales.”

<b>Do You Work Well Under Pressure?</b>
This is an easy question to answer if you have done your research and prepared for this question. (Tip – telling the employer that you crumble under pressure and burst into tears is not going to help you get the job). Although this is a closed question and can be answered with a one word answer, always provide an example of a time where you worked under pressure and how you rose above the pressure to succeed.
Tip: It may seem obvious, but keep the example work-related. I have interviewed a young man who told me that he kicked the winning goal with only one minute left on the clock. It may have been an example of working well under pressure, but what I was really asking for was a work-related answer.

<b>How Do You Handle Change?</b>
This is a classic interview question that always makes a candidate think! It is incredible the amount of times a candidate will say “I handle change well” before an awkward silence as they try to think about an example. Change is natural part of life and it is about adapting to change that makes you a stronger person. Choosing to embrace change is an opportunity for personal growth.
The best answer is that you embrace change rather than opposing change out of fear or routine. No matter what the job throws at you, you’re able to handle it. Provide an example of where you were able to handle change and come out stronger as a result.

<b>Briefly Describe Your Ideal Job?</b>
This is a “curve ball” question. My ideal job would be earning a million dollars a week and only working about 3-4 hours a day. Perhaps my ideal job is playing first base for the New York Yankees. Either way, neither of these answers is right. The right answer to this question is to keep it in line with the characteristics of the job and company you are interviewing with. Concentrate on your strengths and what you best bring to the job. A sample answer would be along the lines of, “My ideal job is where I can utilize my key strengths including X, Y, and Z and as a valued member of the team make a positive and significant contribution.”

<b>What Makes You Want To Work Hard?</b>
This is a good question from the interviewer’s perspective, but also an easy question to answer if you’re prepared. If we were to answer this question in a court room under oath a large percentage of people (myself included) would naturally say material rewards, higher salary, big bonus, perks etc. Luckily we are not in a court room. Focus more on being part of a successful team, adding value to the organisation and the satisfaction you derive from it.

<b>How Would Your Co-Workers Describe You?</b>
This is a time for you to show off the attributes that make you unique and further convince the interviewer that you are the right person for their organization. This question is designed for you to put forward your strengths, but remember there is a difference between pride in how you believe you’re perceived and arrogance. Answers such as “My co-workers think I am wonderful” or “They think that I am the greatest thing since sliced bread” do not go down well in interviews. As per every good answer, provide examples of accomplishments you have achieved.

<b>What Motivates You?</b>
This is a great interview question and a question that every potential job seeker should ask themselves while preparing for the interview. The right answer is providing a mixture of what motivates you as a person and what motivates you about the job you are applying for. Remember to be specific and tailor your answer to the job you are applying for.
Question: Do you mention money or not?
Typically saying that money or benefits motivates you is not the response a hiring manager is looking for. But as per always, the rules change depending on what industry you are applying for. For example, if you are applying for a sales role that offers high commission, being motivated to succeed and earn greater commission is definitely a motivation. Rather than just saying money motivates me (which is not advised), tell the interviewer that you are motivated to sell and succeed and enjoy working in an environment where the more you put in, the more you can gain in return.

<b>What Are Your Salary Expectations?</b>
It goes without saying that everyone wants to make as much money as possible. The best way to answer this question is by researching the market value of the job you are applying for. Honesty is the best policy when it comes to salary expectations because if you are looking for a role that pays 60,000 but the role will only pay 40,000, it won’t be long before you begin to lose interest in the role and start searching all over again for a new job. Show the hiring manager that you have thoroughly researched the role and have an understanding of how much the role pays. Many people try to avoid giving the interviewer a straight answer when answering this question as not to “rock the boat”.
<b>The Worst Answer is a “Desperate Answer”.</b>
Example Question: What are your salary expectations for this job?
Example Answer: “I’m easy – whatever you guys are willing to pay.”
<b>A Good Answer is a “Researched Answer”</b>
Example Question: What are your salary expectations for this job?
Example Answer: “From my research, I know that the salary range for this position is between $60,000 and $70,000 – having worked in the industry for 5 years I feel that my value would fit into this range”.',
