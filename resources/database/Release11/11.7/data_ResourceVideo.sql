'Balancing work & life',
'Well I suppose getting a better work-life balance is a challenge for just about everybody in the workforce. And I think time management is a real key and prioritizing what you do.
So, I like to get a "to-do list" each day and I like to start each day sitting down, writing out what my plan is for that day, and then reflecting on what my plan is for that week.
The problem people have with time management at work is that work always seems to override personal things. "I''ll be home to read to a story to you," you say to your daughter, and something comes up because your boss wants you to do something and you never get home to do that, so your daughter''s disappointed and things get in the way.
So, I''m a great believer in looking at what an employee''s issues are in their life, about their family and their own personal developments. So, I like to see in someone''s weekly planner when they''re going to the gym. I like to see time-out because I''m a great believer that "face-time", what I call "face-time" is I got to work, people were always telling me "Oh, I was at work at 8.30 or 8.00 and I didn''t leave until 9.00" or ring you on Saturday morning to tell you "Oh, I just popped into work to do some things"; all those things, are to me what I call "face-time". I''d like to see people who put in these hours and produce things. So, I never really worry about the amount of time someone''s spending at work, I worry about their outputs and their productivity.
So, in their weekly planner, I like to see organised time slots for what they''re doing and I like to see them telling other people who are in the organisation "I''m sorry, I''ll come back to you about that", take a note about that but continue to work to what they''ve got in their diary, ah ... in their planner.

An open plan is the worst environment for losing time at work because people just wander up to your work station and start talking to you when you''re on the phone or you''re trying to think, or you''re writing halfway through your submission or proposal. So that''s one of the big time wasters, just say you''ve got be really strong, put your hand up, communicate to that other work person that "I can''t talk to you now, I''m focused on doing this". And measure your time, measure what your outputs are, and the time you put into those things.
So, just good time management is the best way to get good work-life balance because you weave into your diary through the week, the 5 days that you are at work, things that replenish you as an employee, whether it''s a walk around the block, whether it''s a trip to the gym, whether it''s to the hairdresser''s, and I know that''s a very important thing for women in the workforce. Guys just rush along and get a hair cut in 20 minutes and back to work, it''s really not an issue for them. So I''d like to see those personal things in people''s diary.',

'Interview tips #1',
'What impresses me, is when I''m talking to somebody who I can really feel has researched my business, my organisation. So, gone online and done any searches they can for any articles, so they actually understand my business, they know the sort of business I''m in, and they know something about me.
So I think that tells me they''re interested. Someone coming and just saying "Well, I''m looking for a job as a recruitment consultant." ... well, they can get a job in hundreds of companies as a recruitment consultant, but why my company? Why me?
I think that''s a really important thing, to be interested enough to have done the research. Really, really good candidates know things about my business that I don''t, which really surprise me. So they weave it into the interview somewhere. So that''s the first thing. To know about the organisation you''re applying [to].
There''s just so much information out there. There''s no reason or excuse that you shouldn''t be able to find out something about the organisation you''re applying for.',

'I think the second thing, that I find is really important, is ''Ok, you''re a recruitement consultant, but what are you going to do for me?'', ''Why are you different?'' and ''What are you going to do for my organisation that other people are not going to do?''.
So, think about yourself. Think about your strengths and talk to those things about why you are different, and what you are going to do for me.
A lot of people don''t realise they''ve got to have a reason to buy. An employer is the buyer, the candidate (in an interview situation) is the seller; although in very clever organisations they sell themselves to the candidate as well.
But ''Why should I buy?'' should be another perspective, looking at it from the candidate''s point of view.',

'And thirdly, I think feeling that you have a match, in an emotional sense and a non-employment sense, so you like the values of the organisation.
"I''m aligned to the mission that you have as an organisation, I like the social attitude you put on your internet site, I like the way you have community involvement and you use your employees in the community. I like those things. I like the values and the reason that you want to be, as a organisation."
So, not only am I aligned in a professional sense, I''m aligned in an emotional and value-base sense. So I''m not like this (gestures misaligned hands), I fell I''m like that (demonstrates alignment).
That''s really what people want in an employee.
People don''t usually leave for money, the reason people leave jobs is about seven or eight. Number seven or eight – the money. But number one is they feel emotionally detached from the organisation. So, on the way in, you need to be able to say that I''ve looked at your organisation, your annual reports, the web-site; I''ve looked at all of these things and I really feel aligned with the values and the purpose of your business.',

'Advice on resigning',
'Well I think, it''s an emotional time for a person resigning, and it''s an emotional time for the organisation, so you''ve got to be sensitive, I think. It''s the first thing you''ve got to be when you''re resigning.
You''ve got to really talk about the organisation, the benefits the organisation''s given you because obviously resigning hopefully to go to something better. So you talk about all the benefits, and all the ups and good times you had with the organisation and we all know that you never always have only good times, sometimes you have bad times, sometimes you have good times at work and at home. But you always leave an organisation with a positive output, you make sure that all the work that you''ve been doing is finished in an exemplary way (I can''t even say it), an exemplary way, and that when people talk about you when you''re gone, it''s all positive.
So, you don''t leave anything undone, you don''t leave any bad feelings. You cover off all the relationships that you had in an organisation, and you communicate very clearly with everyone and you thank them for their support. So I''m always about thinking that one day I may want to come back and work in that organisation again. And if I do, I want them to have a positive view about me. I talk about where I''m going and what I''m going to do if I''m able to do that, if it''s not confidential, and I talk about what this organisation''s given me and how it''s enabled me to move on to something new and exciting, and different. Not necessarily better, just new and exciting, and different.
And I always think about the other person''s view because if I''m being retrenched, I know what it feels like as an individual to be let down, if you like. Because when someone resigns, the organisation certainly feels that they''ve been let down a little bit, particularly if it''s someone that they really, really, really value. Because it''s probably going to take them 6 weeks ... up to 6 months to replace you. So you have to be sensitive about the timing as well.',

'Disliking your boss',
'Lots of people probably feel they can''t stand their boss. I think the obvious answer is, get out of there. I mean you can''t go to work and feel like you can''t stand your boss.
But I think [you should] sit down and write down all the reasons why you feel you can''t stand your boss, and if your boss is the ultimate manager in that business, then you got a problem. If your boss is one of many managers and you might be able to be moved then I think you need to be objective about why you''re having issues with that person and look at them unemotionally. Try and ask some peers about what they think about how... Try and look at yourself, first of all, and wonder why you have this animosity between you and your boss, what can you do about it.
And if you look at all those things and you really feel there''s nothing you else can do in that relationship, then I think you''ve seriously got to think about talking to someone more senior, talking to the Human Resources people about the issues you''ve got with that person, and asking them for guidance. And maybe you get moved to another area or another section in the business, maybe that person''s got issues with you, that you might have done something that they''ve sort of harboured, that''s coming across as really negative vibes towards you, so may be both of you need to be counselled.

But I think sitting there doing nothing is no good, just saying "I''m leaving" is no good. Because why should you leave a company because you hate your boss? Ok? So, have a look at it, trying to get the objectivity into it rather than the emotional feelings we all get when we got that sort of a clash of personality, and bring in where you can Human Resources people or more senior management to try and talk to that person because usually when you get to the point where you hate your boss, there''s not a lot of chance of you and them working that out yourself, you need someone else to help you.',

'Managing stress',
'I think workplace safety''s certainly been improving over the years. I mean if you look at what the practices used to be 20 years ago. But the one thing that''s gone absolutely crazy in all of our surveys and all of the emails we get here is that stress is a major issue. It''s gone ballistic, some people have said.
So I''d like to... I love open plan, because it allows me to walk around and I can see the change in people''s faces. So if you''re lucky enough to have that sort of environment, a manger can be looking for the people who are stressed.
Some people take on projects, some people say, at work, "Yes, I can do it, yes I can do it". They just take on so much that it weighs them down. And the irony is they''re working long hours, they''ve got too much to do, then they''re not managing their time effectively.
So I think when you feel like you''re stressed, you''ve actually got to stop. You''ve got to do the opposite of what the stress is trying to tell you to do. You''ve got to stop, draw a line in the sand, sit down and analyse what you''ve got to do.
The first thing you do is to write down a list of what the priorities are, because the irony about urgent things are, what was urgent today ceases to be urgent tomorrow and certainly the day after, no one is even thinking about it.
So you''ve got to re-organise things often. Stress is usually a part of poor organization and certainly poor time management and probably a bit of a behavioral issue where you, as an employee, are taking on more than you should, and you''re not sharing the load.
So sit down, think about why you''re in this situation, write out a bit of a situational analysis, i.e. a to do list about what I''ve got to do, and then certainly start to talk to people about ''I''m going to be able to deliver on these three things, I''m going to fail on these, and I''m certainly going to get nowhere near these.'' And you''ve got to talk to your supervisor, your manager or your peers about getting some help on the areas that you''re not delivering.
So, in short, just be well-organised and recognise it. That''s a really big thing because we get into the vicious circle where we don''t recognise and we just go ... down. So, when you''re looking haggard in the mirror, draw a line in the sand.',

'Networking inside your organisation',
'Well, networking inside an organisation to better your career is a critical thing, and I don''t mean sucking up to the boss. I mean understanding how an organisation works.
And the first thing you''ve got to do to be good network within your organisation is to be interested in that company. Be interested in the products that the company produces, understand where it fits in the business cycle. So understand and take an interest in where you work, that''s the very first thing.
The second thing you need to do is you need to be really interested in people. I see a lot of people walk into their business every day and say "Hi!" to the person on the front desk, "How''re you going?" and just keep walking.
They actually are not interested in that person, it''s just a reflex action. They could stop for 15 seconds and say "Hi Mary!", "Hi Bill!", "How was your weekend?" or "What did you get up to?", "How''re things going?", "Everything going alright?" and just that little moment where you take time to look into that person''s eye and say "I''m interested in you as an individual" is what networking is all about.
And networking, people get distracted sometimes, they think networking''s about "up" networking. Networking is networking all over the organisation, to the "little" people and to the "big" people. Everybody''s equally important. And so, being interested in the business, being interested in the people in the business, shows that you''re passionate about your workplace.
And you can do extra things, you can think about people, you can bring in articles, you can know that someone likes mint in their tea. So one day you can bring mint out of your garden, or your parents'' garden, and bring that in and give it to them. Just those little extra things that nobody else does.
It''s sure not sucking up to me, the boss, that makes me feel someone''s a great networker. It''s someone who is interested in everybody in the organisation and what we do.
Things you should never do in a job interview
Classics, which are a lot to do with nerves, but:
Forgetting the consultants name
Forgetting the name of the company they''re applying for
Forgetting to bring their resume
Making things up about themselves
[Making things up] about how much experience they''ve got
Forgetting the address, and being late
So, you think of any excuse you can think of, we''ve heard them all.
When you''re in an interview situation, an organisation, an employer or recruiter should understand - it''s one of the most stressful things a person can do. Changing jobs is one of the most stressful things, next to buying a home, buying a car, having a child, getting married, getting divorced, having some sort of emotional trauma. Right up there with all of those things is an interview and trying to get a new role.
So, anyone doing the interviewing has to have some compassion and understanding. But you see just incredible things. I''ve seen candidates so tired, falling asleep, forgetting the question.
Talking for too long. You get asked a question, they answer it, then they answer it again, then they answer it again and answer it again. They think, by talking, over and over and over, that will convince the interviewer that they''re the right candidate.
You need to think.
I always say to people - The motto, particularly for all of us to remember, is that we have two ears, two eyes and one mouth and a nose and we need to use our senses, our sensory perception skills, in that order.
So, listen a lot, look a lot and speak only as needed. And I think that''s the motto for a really good interview.',

'Mothers returning to work',
'This is one of the most challenging things we come across, because the first thing a mother feels after having been at home with young children and managing the house, particularly for the first time, is they feel like they''ve been disconnected, and they probably lack a fair bit of self worth, because they don''t value, or feel the community ... the work community values what they''ve been doing, so they feel disconnected.
My view is a bit different. I, if I''m looking at time management, and we''ve talked a bit about time management, my perfect model for a great time manager is a mother working with a child or children.
If you ask them what they do and how they manage their day and their week, they get out of bed very early, they do all these things they do play lunch and lunch and get everything ready, get their husband out of bed usually, get them going, drop the kids at daycare or school or wherever it is and then get to work. And they go home again and they usually cook dinner and get everything organised for the kids for school the next day.
So if you want a good time manager, a working mother is one of the best you can get.

So, I''m a great fan of women returning to work, only because of my philosophy.
But I think the first thing they should do is to feel that they''ve been doing a worthwhile thing. That''s a very important thing. They haven''t lost the skills they had before they had their child. Those skills are still there. And a working mother doesn''t have to be totally disconnected. There''s the Internet these days, there''s magazines, and newspapers. They can keep up to date, and they can also once they''ve decided to go back to work, they can do a bit of a ramp up, if you like, on what the business community has been doing and the target organisations that they''re looking to go and join, they can start to research that organisation, upgrade their knowledge and skills about what the company has been doing.
So they can get themselves on the runway early with knowledge and information.
And it''s very easy to research companies these days, and it''s very easy to look a bit historical about what they''ve been doing while they might have been out of the workforce. So, value who they are, value what skills they have, realise that there are lots of out there for talented people, and people who need to get back to the workforce.
Good quality time management in employees is the critical thing. So I''m a real fan of women returning to the workforce.',

'What a good resume looks like',
'Well, the number one mistake everybody makes is they put too much information in their Resume. And 99% of employers and recruiters never finish reading most resumes because they''re too long.
So, it needs to be concise, factual and hard hitting. A resume needs to tell me, the employer or the recruiter, why I should interview this person and why I''m keen to hire them.
So it needs to target itself to me and the job that you''re applying for and particularly the organisation you’re looking to join. So, it needs to have those key little points in it that make me want to buy.
So if I''m motivated by an organisation that''s got a big vision, an open plan, and IT, then I need to see in that resume, someone who''s happy to work in a team environment, I need to see someone who really passionately loves IT, not just at work, but in other parts of their life. So I need to see buying signals.
And the other real key thing I need is a set of dot-points giving me what your strengths are, and what other people have said about things you''ve achieved in your work life, OK.
Testimonials are really important. And I know that you could write whatever you want, but a good employer or recruiter will ring up and check those testimonials. So, just the key things about who you are, what your strengths are and what you''re looking for in life.
Honesty is an incredibly powerful tool when you''re looking for work and you should use it.',

'Asking for a payrise',
'That''s one of the most difficult things you can do, is ask for a pay-rise. Another one is resigning, that''s a difficult thing, but focusing on asking for a pay rise I think, firstly you''ve got to have information about:
How did you perform in the past twelve months, in your role?
Did you have KPI''s? (Key Performance Indicators) against which you performed, and how you fared against those;
What you''re looking for, in the future, with the organisation.
So you don''t just go in and say "I think I''m worth more money." You actually sit down and think objectively about the work you''ve done in the past 12 months, how you went, what you''re looking for in the next 12 months.
And then, if you''re clever, you get on the Internet and you''ll come onto to something like LinkMe, and you''ll compare yourself to other people in similar jobs and you''ll have a view, an objective view, to talk to your boss about. About where you compare with your peers, doing similar sorts of jobs, what sort of money they''re looking for.
You can look in the newspaper, look at job advertisements for the similar role that you''re doing now, and see what salaries are being offered. So, if you''re with a small company, and they''re offering salaries similar to yours in small companies, but they''re offering more money in medium or larger companies, you can get a perspective on where you sit in the job market.
Another way, before you ask your boss for a job, is to go to a recruiter and talk to a recruiter about what you''re doing now and what you might be able to get in the next move you make, or if they moved you in the same role, what sort of salary you would be getting there.
So, in other words, plan and think objectively.
Show your boss that you''ve understood what you''re doing now, what you want to do in the future, and you understand your value, and so you are confident.
I always say, information is knowledge, knowledge is power. So when you talk to your boss about getting more money, be professional about it. Be objective. Give him, or her, information to allow them to make a decision to say yes for you, because most bosses are nervous about "Oh, I know I''ve got to give you an increase, and we''ll make it CPI - just a cost of living increase". But you should say, ok - cost of living is 5 percent, but I think I''ve performed over and above most people and these are the reasons why, and this is what I think I should be getting.
So, make it easy for your boss to give you a salary increase.',

'Changing your career',
'Well, I think WHY people want to change is a really important question.
Because a lot of people work at things that they actually don''t love. They just sort of ... they live from Friday night until Sunday night, and then they work from Monday morning until Friday night.

And one of the things that impresses me about people these days is, firstly, you don''t actually have to have a degree in the area you want to work in. You can study what you like, what a passion is, and you can work at something else.
Conversely, you can study at something that you think gives you a really good foundation. You might do Economics, but you might want to be in Human Resources or you might want to be in Real Estate Sales, or something totally different.
So, these days, I think it''s important to try and learn, for a foundation for your work, and realise that the first qualification might only be the basis and you might go on to two or three different qualifications, and the same goes for jobs.
So, the people I see, who are best at doing what they do at work, are the people who are passionately and emotionally involved in what they doing. I mean, you''re in the IT area, and people who are in IT - they speak a different language. You know, they talk code to each other and no-one else can understand what they''re talking about. If they''re in the public service, they can talk about a whole range of things by using SD4 and KR1 and no-one else knows what they''re talking about, because they''re so involved emotionally, they love what they''re doing. [And] I think that''s the best job you can have, ever, is one you''re just busting to get out of bed, because you''ve been thinking about your job, really excited by it and motivated by it, those people don''t get tired by going to work. They get pumped by going to work.
So, if I think you are looking to change your career, totally, change to something that you really love.
And change to something that you feel you''d be really good at.',

'Leveraging off people',
'Well I suppose in a word these days that''s called "networking", and networking''s alive and well. From school, people have used "the old boy network", (you''ve heard that before), which is a sort of an incestuous networking thing.
But these days networking''s a much broader thing and it''s much more respected by both individuals and organisations. So, I think you use your friends to talk about what do they think you''re good at. So, use people you know to get an objective view about who you are and what you''d be good at and then, you''ve got something you can look for. So, who do they know? Does anyone know anyone in the IT industry? Who do know that works at Google? Your auntie, your brother, so ask all your relatives, send out emails to all of your friends. And the other way you can do it, which is something I really like, is if you''re talking about an IT organisation, you start going along to functions that IT people go to, and you start looking for people who work in the organisation that you''ve targeted, that you want to join in and you say very up-front: "How do I get a job in your organisation? I''ve loved it forever." "Who are people that would hire a person with my skills and attributes in your organisation?" "How do I approach them? Where do they go to?" So try and meet the people out of the work environment.
It''s not devious, it''s not being sneaky, it''s just being clever. That''s what networking''s about: using that leverage, other people''s knowledge and other people''s contacts to help you get what you want, and it''s not a bad thing. I don''t mind when people ring me up and say "This is what I''m looking for. Do you know anyone who''s can help?" It''s not a big deal to help people who are asking, it doesn''t take long these days to click on a mouse and forward a CV, or forward a contact or ring someone up and say, you know, "Paul Tyrrell, he''s going to call you, can you please look after him?"',

'Why a career is important',
'LinkMe: So, Geoff, why is a career important?
Geoff: Because it keeps recruiters in work, every time you change your job, the recruiters... No, sorry, I''ll get serious.
Now I think, a career, I have always had a view ever since Andrew [Banks] and I worked together that career is a critically important thing in people''s lives, so I''ve always felt as a recruiter that we do things in the community that can help people better their lives.
So, I know sounds a bit corny, but, I see our soldiers as equally important as a doctor that looks after someone''s health; we look after someone''s corporate health and their own personal well being and satisfaction.
If someone''s got a good career, and they''re excited by it, they''re motivated by it, they feel like they''re growing, they really feel good in life. And in their, what I call a ''life cycle driver'', if career is the middle of the circle, it affects your health, it affects where you live, it affects the sort of car you drive, it affects the sort of holidays you go on, it affects how you manage and help your family, it affects everything that you do in life.
So, it''s a key component. It''s 5 days out of 7 that you''re at work, so it''s a critical part of your life and all the people who are there, are usually, are most of them, your best friends.
So, it''s a core part of what you do. So you need to make sure that you love what you do, you''re motivated everyday when you get out bed and you want go to that place of work, and you feel like keep growing in that environment. Because that''s what builds your self esteem and we all want to feel good about ourselves in life, we want to look in that mirror, and look at that person, looking back at you, and think ''I''m proud of you; you''re doing a really good job'' and if you don''t feel like that everyday, you need to be looking to do something else because you deserve to have a job like that.',

'Being retrenched',
'Well, I think people who are retrenched, immediately their first thought is they have been sacked, and people are using retrenchment as a nice way of saying "We don''t want you anymore". The good news is twenty years ago, being retrenched was a real stigma. Today many people are being retrenched. Organisations are changing, upsizing, downsizing, being taken over, merged, so retrenchment''s now just a normal part of being at work.
But I think it''s an opportunity, I think you should ... the moment you get over the sort of awful feeling of saying "I''m out of work", (if it''s a good organisation, of course, they''ll be managing a program for you to help you find more work, but not many organisations manage job process effectively,) so you have to be the manager of your next opportunity.
And I think once you get over the shock, I think if you sit down and try and think about things, saying "this is a chance for me to do something new ... maybe better." OK? "This is a chance for me to do something new," and "What do I really want to do? What do I love in life? What do I do in that job? And what didn''t I like about it? What would I like to change?"
So, take it as an opportunity, try to be really positive about it, ask other people what they think you''re good at. Look at yourself, think about what you love, what your passions are in life, and maybe go and get that job that you''ve always dreamed of.
But certainly, don''t worry, because there''s more work out there, even if you''ve got to take on something temporarily as a waiter or something in the hospitality business or a call center until you get what you want, it''s an opportunity for real change.',
