'Deciding on a Career in Banking',
'It was 7.00am on a Monday morning and as I sat on the train on the way to work I found myself behind two gentlemen in designer suits who I instinctively expected to be bankers. I was right. They soon started talking about their respective workplaces.
I became further intrigued as they tried to convince each other that they should jump ship to each others’ firms. The first man worked at a well respected global investment bank which he said was expecting a “big year” in 2011. On the flip side, this meant more time away from his family.
The second guy worked for a boutique bank. He was happy that his travelling days were behind him but moaned about the lack of training that his company was providing to new hires, especially at graduate level. He was spending a lot of time working one-on-one with new employees, which he wasn’t happy about.

<b>Working out the benefits</b>
The man from the global IB mentioned a new gym membership for all employees but said with his hours, working out was not on the agenda. His friend didn’t get this benefit but had vowed to work fewer hours this year to make more time for himself and his family.
Listening to both men got me thinking about the pros and cons of large banks and niche ones. While the fundamentals of your work will be the same, the application of that work can vary.

<b>Where everybody knows your name</b>
The major difference I think is culture. Employees in a boutique are more like family and the whole firm knows your name. In a big bank you probably only interact with members of your team and know little about other people and their duties.
A boutique can therefore have a friendlier feel to it and people work together rather than competing against each other. You have a strong support network, which can be accessed a lot easier than at a larger institution.
Working for a big bank typically means you have one distinct job function, while at a smaller company you are often exposed to several different roles based on current projects. With less hierarchy and fewer processes, boutique employees have a greater chance to expand their knowledge. Being part of a smaller team can also let you stand out and be recognised for your contribution.

<b>Size sometimes matters</b>
However, the prestige of working for a large, well respected bank can be a huge advantage, and you will get fantastic perks and benefits. Although there is a feeling of being small fish in a large pond, having a specific role that you are solely responsible for can provide better future opportunities if you want to process your career in that job function. Training opportunities are generally much greater and more highly regarded by potential employers.

Overall, you need to find the right firm for you, based on factors such as those above. And no matter where you’re working, the atmosphere will be demanding. That’s the very nature of the banking industry – it’s a sink-or-swim culture.',

'Time to Graduate',
'Don’t despair! Just because there is doom and gloom in the world does not mean businesses are not hiring. It does however mean that competition for the job you are searching for is even more competitive than ever. So how do you get a step ahead of your competition?
Just like Nike and Adidas are two of the most recognisable brands in the world, as a graduate you need to think of yourself as a brand that you are selling to potential employers. Consider what makes you exclusive — why should an employer give you the job? If you don’t think your special enough to work for a particular organisation than why are they going to choose you out of all the people applying for the same job?  Remember that your resume is one of a potential 100 / 200 if not 500 resumes sitting on the employer’s desk. The hiring manager or recruitment agent have limited time in reading your resume so in order to stand out among hundreds of other applicants you have to market yourself effectively.

<b>First impressions count so make sure the right one is made about you.</b>
The most important rule for a graduate is the message you convey to a potential employer. Everything you say and do should reinforce the idea that you are indeed the perfect candidate for the position. You have the required skills to fulfil the role and the organisation which you are applying for is 100% the place where you want to work.
If the role demands attention to detail, demonstrate these qualities through your punctuality and error-fee resume, and illustrate them with experiences about previous positions. Don’t waste time on information that doesn’t reflect your suitability for this particular position. 
In the technological age we live in and the world changing each and every day, employers are likely to seek and be impressed with graduates who demonstrate flexibility and adaptability, showing that they will be able to cope with these future changes.

One last thing – <b>Stay positive</b>
No one says it’s easy to get a job. These days many industries are increasingly competitive, and the job-hunting period can be difficult and long. It may take a considerable length of time and multiple rejections before you find your first job. Getting a foot in the door is often the hardest part of the whole job process.',

'Top 20 Best Summer Jobs',
'Ideally the best thing you can do is try to find an internship which is related to your degree or passion. One of my favourite rockers, Ozzy Osbourne worked in a slaughterhouse before rising to fame with Black Sabbath! This is the best way to gain real life experience as well as having something terrific to put on your resume. For example, if you’re studying business then an Intern in a big financial bank would be fantastic and also good pay (but long hours!) In reality however you have left finding an internship to the last moment and now you find yourself searching for a summer job that pays well without consuming your entire summer.
No matter what job you’re doing over the summer never forget to network. Speak to people, ask questions, learn new skills and most importantly have fun.
And if you think you’re too good for a summer job think again. Some of the biggest stars in the world spent their summer mopping floors at a local Dairy Queen (Gwen Stefani) or saved up some extra cash as a paper boy (Tom Cruise). Matthew McConaughey found himself short of cash when travelling around Australia (before he was famous) and took a job on a farm moving chicken manure.

'What are the best ways for students to spend their summers?',
'<b>Internship</b>
Internships provide opportunities for students to gain experience in their chosen fields, determine if they have an interest in a particular career, create a network of contacts, or earn school credit. Although you may feel that graduation is still a long way off, if you can gain experience in your chosen area, you will help to reduce the challenge of interviewing post-graduation without any real work experience. Remember there are at least 3 summers as a college student. If you can make use of at least one of them it will put you in a good position when your time comes to graduate.

<b>Travelling</b>
Travel and experience the world! Broaden your mind and experience different cultures and traditions. From the beaches of Australia to the jungles of Brazil, the memories you gain while travelling are priceless and you just never know who you’re going to meet along the way. Go see the world while you can – you have the rest of your life to work!

<b>Volunteering</b>
Volunteer your time for free. This could include working for free for a company related to your field of interest or sacrificing your time to help others (there’s no better feeling than helping those less fortunate than ourselves). In the long-term, volunteering looks great on your resume, and it could open doors for future opportunity. Remember to network. This is by far the most important advice to give a student.

<b>Combine travelling and working</b>
Find a job or internship in a foreign country. Perhaps learn a new language. You never know the opportunities that can present themselves.

Spend time with your family and friends
Get some exercise, stay healthy and active!
Whatever you decide, just make sure you have fun and enjoy yourself.
