'10 Tips to Staying Positive While Looking for a New Job',
'Don’t let the media and the news put you down. No matter how bad they say it is companies are always looking to hire the best available staff. If you have the right skills and passion, there will be a job waiting for right around the corner. You just need to remain upbeat and positive. Below is a list of things you need to do in order to help you through the job search process…
Keep a routine: Don’t get into the bad habits of waking up late, sleeping in the afternoons or procrastinating around the house. Get up at your normal time, eat properly and get some exercise (walking is free)!
Volunteering at a church, hospital, homeless shelter or non-profit organization will open your eyes to people who are less off than you and give you a sense of contribution. There is no greater reward than helping people who are less fortunate than us.
Stay up to date with what’s happening in your industry: Don’t let yourself fall behind just because you’re not working. The best approach is to learn more about your particular industry. This way you will be ahead of your competition when it comes time to interview.
Explore potential new careers: It’s never too late to try to learn a foreign language or a new piece of computer software. I remember working with a senior archaeologist of 10 years experience who came to me wanting a change in his life direction. After 6 months of learning Spanish and then travelling through Spain for another 6 months, the senior archaeologist is now a junior English/Spanish translator!
Positive Thinking: Do not focus on the negatives – you need to be able to bounce back. Concentrate on the skills and knowledge you have. Sitting around saying “what if” all the time is only going to further depress you.
Support Group: You may feel as though you’re the only person in your situation without a job, but guess what – you’re not. Reach out to people for support. There are many groups that provide excellent assistance in the areas of resume writing, interviewing, and job hunting. Aside from the secular groups, there are also many faith groups ready to offer you a supporting hand. Don’t feel ashamed or embarrassed to ask for help. Let people help you change your life.
Avoid negative people! Negative thinking is of no value to you. You need to be around positive people and people who can have a positive impact on your life.
Network: maintain contacts and stay in touch with people. Make sure you network with positive people!! Again, avoid negativity. Negative thinking does nothing to help your situation.
Last but not least – manage your expectations. Not every job you apply for will be a success. Don’t be put off by this. Instead, concentrate on the positives and look at what you achieve each day. For example, you could have applied to 3 great jobs, connected with 2 people who are great resources or maybe you found a course or book that will help to improve your skills.
Don’t give up! Jobs don’t find you, you find them!',

'Listing Salary Requirements',
'Some job advertisements ask you to include your desired salary, and if they ask for this, it usually means that you can’t avoid doing so. Listing salary requirements is always tricky because it’s hard to “guess” what the employer will think about your preference. Asking for too much can rule out your chances right away because you might appear unrealistic, but asking for too little can signal a red flag and tell the hiring manager that you don’t value your skills and experience. So the question is – what do you say?
My advice is to always include a range because you give yourself a little bit of breathing room. A range not only eliminates you from this potential scrutiny, but it could also tell the hiring manager that you need a little more information before you give them a definite answer. In other words, you leave yourself some option, and you also put yourself in a good position to negotiate. Chances are that full details of the job haven’t already been provided, so if you make it to the interview and hear more about the job’s requirements, you can then argue why you are qualified to receive the higher end of your salary range.
So how do you determine this range? Try to search for similar positions and what they offer in terms of salary. Look up job search websites and try to ballpark a range that most of the positions fit into, and then use this range when you’re writing your cover letter. The range you include is entirely dependent on what you find, but I would probably suggest not making it any larger than $10,000 – it may be too general otherwise.
All in all, it’s always best to keep your options open.',

'Switching Up Your Job Seeking Tactics',
'Many times, job applications go entirely unnoticed. A friend of mine recently tried something new because she realized she wasn’t getting any interview requests. Like most people, she would search through popular websites and apply for jobs straight away, always including a personalized cover letter and resume. Then she’d wait and “hope for the best.” And nothing happened. It was at this point that she started re-applying for the same positions. And guess what? She received a couple of invitations to interview.
This is not the first time I’ve heard of this happening. In this age of emailed applications and very little personal contact, it’s hard to figure out why the interview requests are not coming. Of course, this has a lot to do with the quality of your resume and cover letter, but sometimes it can also be just because of plain bad luck. In some cases, your application could have just gone unnoticed through no fault of your own. Below are some of the reasons for this:

<b>Bad timing</b>
You could have simply applied at the wrong time, literally. A hiring manager could have opened your email while in the middle of something and then simply forgotten about it a minute later. It does happen.

<b>Your application was accidentally deleted</b>
Do you ever quickly go through your email list and hold your finger down on the delete button? You’re not the only one. If a hiring manager is posting advertisements on job websites, the probability of their receiving spam emails is quite high. They could have accidentally deleted your application.

<b>Too many applications</b>
A lot of times, hiring managers will have a stopping point for accepting applications. They either received too many or they’ve already narrowed the list down to just a few candidates. Whatever the reason, they won’t bother to delete the advertisement, and they might automatically delete your application. It is not uncommon, however, for them to become dissatisfied with their applicant pool. When this happens, they’re not likely to review the same applicant pool from before – they’ll focus on the new applicants.
My advice is to always try again because you never know what may happen. I am not suggesting that these scenarios happen all the time, but they do happen somewhat frequently, so give yourself the benefit of the doubt. ',

'The Psychology of Colour',
'Preparing for a job interview is tough work. You rehearse answers to common questions, decide on what clothing to wear and ensure you have done an adequate amount of research into the company. But what about the colour of your clothing – does this matter? Is wearing a white shirt with a blue tie going to help you get the job over wearing a blue shirt with a black tie?
Studies have shown that the colours you decide to wear in an interview can actually make a difference. In the competitive world we live in you need to ensure that you take every advantage you possibly can.
Different colours evoke different emotions and it is imperative when you’re interviewing that you evoke the right emotions from the interviewer.

<b>Examples</b>
Blue: Words that describe the colour blue include: trust, loyalty, wisdom, peaceful. These are exactly the type of feelings you want to be portraying in your interview. Blue is a calming colour (Think Ocean and sky) and sends out a signal to the interviewer that you are indeed honest and sincere. Studies have shown that wearing the colour blue to an interview will increase your chances of getting hired more than any other colour.
Red: In contrast to the colour blue, the colour red stirs emotions more than any other colour. Red is a strong colour, very emotional, an extreme colour that in an interview scenario can work against you. Unlike blue which has a calming effect, the colour red is a fiery colour (the colour of love and passion), and can be an intimidating colour for the interviewer.
Orange: Similar to red. A colour that stirs emotion and therefore a colour I would avoid wearing in a job interview. Although orange is not seen to be as an aggressive as the colour red, it is still perceived as a colour that can evoke feelings of power and aggression.
Grey: My second favourite colour to wear after blue. Grey gives the look of sophistication and authority. In a corporate environment the colour grey is professional and portrays an individual as being confident without being intimidating.
Purple: The colour of “Royalty”. The colour symbolizes power, aristocracy, lavishness, and extravagance.
Black: Be careful when wearing just black to an interview.  The colour black is seen as a power colour and can be viewed as threatening. Wearing black outfits can portray an individual as being powerful or even arrogant. Black is also associated with negative implications such as death, sin, and fear.
Just remember that first impressions count a lot when you go to interview. Know your audience and dress accordingly.',
