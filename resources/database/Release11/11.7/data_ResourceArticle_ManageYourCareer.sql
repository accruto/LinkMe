'Before You Ask For a Raise',
'Before you ask for a raise, the most important thing you need to remember is that you need a reason for asking for one. An employer is not just going to hand out extra money to you because they like you – you need to give them a compelling reason to do so.
Basically, you need to give them something that exemplifies your hard work and that shows you are a positive asset to the company. Think of a few ways for doing so – below are just a few examples:

<b>Arriving on time on a consistent basis</b>
No employer likes workers who show up late – ever. If you consistently come to work early or on time, your boss will definitely take notice of this and will appreciate your punctuality. You’ve already given yourself a head start.

<b>Taking on an extra work load</b>
Volunteering to do more than what is expected of you helps to build your reputation within the company. You will be recognized as a leader, as someone willing to help out and as someone who can be counted on. You may also gain some valuable experience within other departments, and extra knowledge never hurts. Employers love this type of employee, and will be more likely to go the extra mile to keep them on board.

<b>Keeping track of your performance</b>
There is nothing better than being able to show concrete examples of how you have benefited the company. Have sales dramatically increased since you came on board? Do you consistently meet or exceed your targets?
Of course, some people argue that taking on an extra work load or working overtime is a negative because you allow the company to take advantage of you. Well, like it or not, this is how the world works. If you want to stay in the same position year after year, do the minimum, but if you want to move up, putting in that extra effort will be required of you. Raises are not free handouts for everyone – they are reserved for the ones who put in the extra effort. ',

'Do I Really Need A LinkedIn Profile?',
'With so many social networking sites now available and new sites being developed on a daily basis, it is often hard to know which networking sites are worthwhile especially in helping to find a new job. 
We have all heard of Facebook and Twitter (If you haven’t where have you been hiding!).. however when it comes to job networking in my opinion every person, no matter if your actively seeking a new job or not, needs to have an updated LinkedIn profile.
Job hunting has changed so much over the past 5-10 years and social networking websites such as LinkedIn has enabled job seekers to reach out directly to networks which previously were never an option. Even if you are currently not seeking new roles, having an updated LinkedIn account certainly cannot hurt. I have never heard of a person who missed out on a job for having a LinkedIn account (How many people may have missed out on being headhunted for not having an active account?)
I recently worked with a young skilled migrant who was in the process of moving from Ireland to Australia. This individual had been granted a skilled migrant visa and was now in the process of trying to find employment before arriving in Australia. Not knowing where to begin or how to start, we began by transferring his resume into a  brand new LinkedIn profile highlighting areas such as his expertise, specialities, skills, awards, publications, education and past work history (all areas that are available to fill in on a LinkedIn profile). We optimised his LinkedIn public profile and reached out to his existing contacts asking for recommendations to add further credibility to his online profile. Last but not least we added an up-to-date professional picture (not a picture taken at 3am on a Saturday night) and uploaded this picture onto his profile. When potential hiring managers read through your profile they want to know that there is a face behind the name and adding a picture to your profile humanises the profile.
Now that his account had been optimised, he was now ready to network and reach out to new contacts through all the different professional groups that LinkedIn has to offer. This job seeking candidate now had a huge advantage of being able to approach people in his network and potentially open new doors that were previously closed. Rather than applying blind to a company and hoping for the best, he was able to strategically build relationships and at the same time giving himself the greatest opportunity of being identified by recruiters through his new optimised profile.
Remember one thing. The more relevant contacts you can build to your network the more exposure you will have to meet potential recruiters, head-hunters and employers. In the twenty first century, where social networking is booming, the LinkedIn platform can allow you to enhance your unique personal brand, connect with hiring authorities and connect with other job seekers who are in the exact same situation as yourself.
Networking is key!',

'How to Make a Career Change',
'It is NEVER too late for a career change! Sure, you might not have direct experience in a certain industry or job, but you need to prove to any hiring manager that your existing skills are, in fact, transferable skills.
If you’re debating about making a career change, don’t be afraid. Even if a career switch later in life seems like a completely radical change with many possible consequences attached to it, you should still go for it if it’s something you really want to do. My best advice is to set up a plan before making the dive. A large-scale transition will not happen overnight, and this is why it’s important to ensure you have a “plan of attack.”
Also, make sure your career change is realistic. Although I encourage everyone to follow their dreams, you also need to stay realistic. If your dream is to become a pilot, but you’ve worked in banking for the last 15 years, the chances of you becoming a pilot are a lot harder (but not impossible)! Also remember to be flexible. You are making a career change that could involve a lower salary or relocation. These are some of the sacrifices you could be asked to make in the short term.
When you begin applying for new roles, you need to ensure your resume is targeted toward this new job. Obviously you are not going to have direct experience, so it’s important to highlight not only your current skills and achievements, but also (and most importantly), that you are able to adapt your skills for this new job.
In making the career change, your skills are by far your best selling point. Many skills that you use on a day to day basis (such as leading, managing, liaising and communicating, for example) are all transferable skills that you can use to prove to a hiring manager that you are right for a particular job.

<b>5 point plan to making a career change</b>
1) Make sure of your reasons for wanting a career change. One bad day at work or hating your boss do not suggest you want to change careers
2) Brainstorming – sit down and brainstorm ideas of the type of industry/job you really want to do
3) Planning – Set out a plan to follow. Make it realistic. Remember your career change won’t happen overnight. Realistically, it can take about 6-12 months. Don’t quit your job on day 1. Included in planning is financial planning. How much is this career change going to cost you? How much do you plan to get paid? You need to know these answers!
4) Networking – Talk to friends, speak to recruitment agents and sign up to online networking sites
5) Executing your plan. Speak to an expert in regards to interviewing, resume writing and cover letter writing. Apply directly, and begin to follow the steps of your plan.',

'The Process of Career Management',
'Career management refers to the planning, supervising, controlling, handling, coping and administrating one’s professional life. It comprehensively covers a detailed view of what you want to be, where you want to go, how you will get there and ultimately how long you intend to stay.
All the answers are directly related to one’s personal goals and targets. Being able to handle changes in your career will best enable you to avoid mistakes of the past, prepare a confident approach to the present and a implement a positive direction for the future. Overall, managing your career will help maintain and develop your professional growth, development and direction.

<b>When should I begin to manage my career?</b>
Successful career management can start as early as the first day you walk into school or college. One should clearly identify their goals before enrolling in a particular degree or course and preparing for a lifelong career. (This saves a lot of money and time later on down the track!)
Be specific with what are you good at and what you enjoy doing;  most importantly what you can see yourself doing every day going forward. Being able to answer these questions will help you in understanding yourself better and what areas you are most likely to succeed.
If you find that you have made a mistake don’t panic. Exhaust your options, understand the value added skills that you have and how best you can utilise these existing skills.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions.  Ask yourself if you are capable of performing the task or if you see yourself progressing in a certain area. If the answer is yes, then begin your quest to achieving your targets. Never forget to network and seek out as many people and opinions as possible. You just never know where the next door will open.

<b>How long does career management last for?</b>
Career management is a lifelong exercise. Balancing your work and social life is a juggling act.  It is not just confined to one period in your life or a particular profession. In life many things change so don’t be afraid to change with the times.  It is all about adaptability and learning.
The ability to learn from every setback will make you smarter in making your next career move. The employment market may seem crowded and not promising, but being open to change will help you survive during those dark months. The changing times are not moments of despair, but rather moments of opportunity.',
