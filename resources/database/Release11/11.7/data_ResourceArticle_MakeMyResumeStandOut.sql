'10 Seconds For Your Resume to Shine',
'One of my favourite books is the "The E Myth Revisited” written by Michael Gerber. In the book Michael speaks about the marketing strategy. He quotes 
"In a television commercial, we''re told; the sale is made or lost in the first three or four seconds. 
In a print ads, tests have shown, 75 percent of the buying decisions are made at the headline alone.
In a sales presentation, data have shown us, the sale is made or lost in the first three minutes"
Same is true for your resume – Reports suggest that a hiring manager will spend no more than 10 seconds reading through your resume before deciding to read on or delete. 
Less and less time is being spent reading a persons resume. In today’s society, hiring managers are more interested in eliminating candidates before they begin their pursuit of finding the perfect candidate.  
When it comes to writing your resume, remember the golden rule of highlighting your achievements and putting them on the front page. No matter how good your achievements, skills, experience and knowledge if the hiring manager has not found them within 10 seconds than your resume will be deleted – and once it is deleted from the inbox it will never be read again.
Your resume is a marketing document – it’s your marketing tool to sell yourself. First impressions count for a lot and if your resume is being deleted than it will be impossible for you to get the job
Do the small things right and your already half way there to your new job!',

'Do I really Need to Use a Professional Resume Writer?',
'People look at me strangely when they ask, “Do I really need to use a professional resume writer?”
“Come on,” they say, “I can easily just write my own resume – what are you going to do that I cannot just do myself?”
Of course it’s true that anybody can write their own resume. The same is true that anyone can attempt to build a house or change the plumbing or paint some artwork, however in each of these examples you’d prefer to call on an expert because of their specific skills, knowledge and experience in their particular trades. The same can be said of a professional resume writer.
How long should a resume be? Should I include a qualifications profile or a career summary? How many duties and responsibilities should I include for my current role? Do I include the same amount of information for all my previous roles and how far back should my resume go?
How about questions relating to “soft skills” – should you include information like “volunteered for the Red Cross”? Is this relevant on your resume? How about the fact that you were the football captain at school – is this relevant?
Have a look at your resume and see if you have words such as “hard working”, “dedicated”, “team player”, or “loyal” – do these type of words enhance or actually detract from your resume? If you are using these types of words do you think your competitors are as well?
And what about achievements – do you have any on your resume? Is a hiring manager going to take one look at your resume and be impressed with your past experiences, skills and success? Have you mentioned initiatives you introduced to the business or awards you have won?
This is what a professional resume writer can do for you. They can open doors to get that interview. Remember – resume writing is not about reinventing the wheel, it is about ensuring that you adequately highlight everything that is required to make sure that your resume is selected and you are given the chance to present yourself in the interview. Once you make it to the interview you have the opportunity to prove to the hiring manager how good you really are. Without a professional resume you may never get this chance.',

'Listing Achievements on Your Resume',
'It’s really important to remember that achievements are essential to every single resume.
I’ve come across so many resumes that include no achievements whatsoever. It’s actually very common to see this, so it’s important that you include achievements in your resume as they provide a lot of value and depth. Most people forget to include achievements on their resumes because they simply don’t know how to communicate them.
The best achievements on a resume are always specific. A lot of people will include “helped to increase sales,” for example, on their resume, and this is far from effective. If you did increase sales, tell me a little more about this. What did you do to achieve this? Did you introduce or implement new tactics into the business? Instead of the generic “helped to increase sales,” include something like “Increased sales by x% over a 6 month period by introducing new methods of revenue generation.” It tells the reader what you did, how you did it, and how successful you were at it.
Be very careful to avoid generic achievements such as “effectively worked in a team environment” or “showed dedication.” I can assure you that plenty of other people will also list these achievements on their resumes, so you need to separate yourself from the competition by being one of the few to specify how you actually displayed those achievements.
It’s essential to remember that hiring managers do not know you, so you need to be as specific as possible. Listing achievements is a good and effective way to do this, and it will definitely aid you in standing out a bit from your competition.',
