'Behaviour Job Interview Questions',
'“Past behaviour is a better predictor of future behaviour”
It is estimated that 80% of the interview is made up of behavioural questions. In order to understand how to answer behaviour questions we need to first define what a behavioural question is.
This type of interviewing is based on the philosophy that your past actions and behaviours will be a good indicator of your future behaviours. Therefore, how you acted to certain circumstances in your previous job is a reliable indicator of how you will act in your new job. As there are literally thousands of behaviour type questions, you can best prepare for this type of questioning by researching the culture of the company to get an understanding of the behavioural traits that are essential to working at that particular organisation.
Behavioural questions differ to standard interview questions as they focus more on experiences, behaviours, knowledge, skills and abilities. Rather than the standard question of “Do you have leadership skills” a behavioural question is more likely to be “Give me an example of your previous role when you displayed leadership abilities.” As the interviewer has already determined which skills are necessary for the role it is important that you are prepared for these questions.
The best way to begin studying for these questions is to look at the job description! The list of skills that they require are the skills they will more than likely focus on. When the job description mentions they require a person with good teamwork skills or negotiation skills, it is more than likely that this will be turned into a behavioural question to see if you really do possess these skills.
In good news, behavioural questions are not to be feared. When prepared properly, these questions can be easily answered.

<b>How to Answer Behaviour Job Interview Questions</b>
The best way to answer a behavioural question is to use the STAR Format.

<b>S</b>ituation
The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.

<b>T</b>ask
What did you have to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation.

<b>A</b>ction
What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it and what were the alternatives.

<b>R</b>esults
What were the outcomes of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives. What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?',

'Ice Breaking Job Interview Questions',
'When you first enter the interview, the opening question is always designed to introduce yourself so you feel comfortable in the surroundings before the questions become more specific. Generally speaking, “ice breaking questions” are broad, yet they can be so important with how they impact the rest of your interview. Just like in a sports game, the opening minutes of the game are not where the game can be won, but where it can potentially be lost. The same goes for the interview – you are not going to get the job because of the answer you provide, but you can lose the job with your answer. Although the ice breaking question will be a general question about yourself or how your day is going, remember this is the hiring manager’s first impression of you. Giving off the wrong first impression can severely affect the outcome of the interview.

<b>Examples</b>
•	Tell me a little about yourself...
•	Were there any problems finding our office today?
•	Have you visited our location before?
•	If there is a major sporting event like the Olympics going on the hiring manager may ask something along the lines of “Have you been following the Olympics?”
•	Would you like some coffee or a glass of water?
•	Are you enjoying this weather?
•	Why have you applied for this role? (Trickier ice breaker question)

The most important aspect of answering an ice breaking question is to build early rapport with the interviewer. As I mentioned, you are not going to get the job just because you answer the ice breaking question in a brilliant way, but answering the question the wrong way can give off the wrong first impression.

<b>Tips</b>
Keep the answer related to the question and be brief and polite. This is not the time to tell the interviewer your life story
Use proper English - If you are asked how you are doing the correct answer would be "Very well thank you, and how are you? or "Fine thank you, how are you today?" - Using slang or lazy English can create an unprofessional or even careless impression.

<b>How to blow the ice breaking question</b>
A colleague of mine was interviewing candidates for a new role. As a polite introduction he would ask the candidate if they found the company building ok. Most of the candidates smiled and said yes to this question. One candidate, however, told the interviewer how it took him a long time to find the building and how his train was late. He rambled on for 2 minutes about the difficulty in finding the building. Before the interview had formally even begun he had already created a negative impression on the interviewer. He had lost the job before the interview had even started.',

'Open-Ended and Closed-Ended Job Interview Questions',
'<b>Open-Ended Job Interview Questions</b>
The one thing to keep in mind with an open-ended question is that you need to give the interviewer more than a yes or no answer. If you do the research beforehand, you will be in a position to adequately open-ended question.

<b>Closed-Ended Job Interview Questions</b>
There are times when an interviewer will need to know a specific piece of information and only require a brief response. My tip is to always answer the question directly in a brief, but complete sentence – never just in a one word answer.

<b>Examples</b>
Q: Have you finished your bachelor degree?
A: Yes I did – I have a Bachelor of Commerce degree, majoring in Finance, from the University of XYZ.

Q: How many years of experience do you have as a truck driver?
A: This is my 6th year as a qualified truck driver with company XYZ.

Q: Are you proficient in using Microsoft Excel?
A: I am an advanced Microsoft Excel user and am also proficient in all Microsoft programs including Word and PowerPoint.
